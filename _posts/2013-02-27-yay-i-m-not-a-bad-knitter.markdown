I did it. I overcame my inability to read instructions properly and finished my damn cute <a href="http://www.dull-roar.com/2011/08/hat-for-eudora.html">hat</a>.

I am obsessed with it. I wore it out this morning when I walked the dog and she seems to be equally pleased with it. I am in love with the contrast hem, welts, and slight slouch.

And yes, I am knitting another with the colors inverted. What?

Although maybe I'll use the right needle size this time...
