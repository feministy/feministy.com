---title:Squinch Shawl

"# ERROR ALERT!!!\n\n**This pattern has errors that make it borderline impossible to knit. More info below.**\n\n* * *\n\nSquinch Shawl is modeled after the curious squinch arches used in buildings with domes. The tiny triangles hold up each vast roof, a centuries old marvel of engineering. Paried with garter stitch, this reversible stitch pattern makes excellent use of both lace and texture.\n\nAlthough official instructions are only provided for one size, this pattern can also be made with worsted weight yarn. You will need approximately 380 yds/347 m of worsted weight yarn at a gauge of 15 sts and 24 rows per 4”/10cm (use whatever needle gets you this gauge). I recommend a true worsted weight, not a light worsted weight.\n\n**A note on errors**\n\n**Please note that if you choose to make this, you will be knitting a pattern with errors**.\n\n_It has been brought to my attention that there is a problem with the chart and the short row setup. I’m not actively designing patterns any longer, so I likely won’t be fixing this. I’m leaving the pattern up in the Ravelry database so existing purchasers are not screwed over by me deleting it or making it free. If you have corrections, let me know and I will post them here._\n\n* * *\n\n### About Arch Shawls\n\nComprised of 3 patterns, the Arch Shawls collection features stitch motifs inspired by elements of Venetian architecture. I don’t claim to be an expert on architecture, but the vast buildings throughout Italy inspired me to create shawls based on the styles used in their unique structures.\n\nAll three shawls are single-skein projects and worked using short rows, each one making use of a cabled, lace, or textured motif.\n\nPatterns may be purchased individually ($6 each) or as a set of 3 ($16).\n\nArch Shawls includes:\n\n- \n\n[Voussoir Shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/voussoir-shawl)\n\n- \n\n[Squinch Shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/squinch-shawl/) (my personal favorite!)\n\n- \n\n[Lancet Shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lancet-shawl)\n\n"
