---title:Perpetually Persistent Cowl
---
"Overzied puffy coats are a new thing for me. I’ve never had to bother zipping a coat all the way up to my nose. I’ve also never had to deal with my nose leaking, and then freezing on my face. Solution? A super tall, super warm, super quick cowl that stands up on its own. This cowl is perpetually, persistently, unnecessarily warm.\n\nIt’s not a secret that I am a bit of a lazy knitter and that I get bored easily. I love patterns that I can finish quickly, but keep me entertained while I am knitting them. Perpetually Persistent Cowl fits the bill with fun, but easy to memorize, cables and only 90 yards/82 m of yarn to work with!\n\n* * *\n\n### About The Great Cowl KAL 2012\n\nI had this crazy idea. It was my first winter in Chicago and I decided to knit myself as many cowls as humanly possible. I challenged myself to knit and design as many as possible so that I could share the fun and do a KAL with my group. Each pattern is designed to build upon a foundation of skills, increasing in complexity (but not difficulty) the further you get into the challenge.\n\nI challenged knitters to complete 5 patterns in 50 days. Everyone had to submit a photo as proof of their completed project, and each knitter who submitted received the next pattern in the series for free. Flurries Cowl received over 500 submissions, and the final cowl received about 100. Approximately 100 knitters completed all 5 patterns in 50 days.\n\nEach pattern in The Great Cowl KAL 2012 is available individually ($6), or in a collection of all 5 patterns ($24).
