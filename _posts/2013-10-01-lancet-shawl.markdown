<p>Lancet Shawl is modeled after the Gothic lancet arches favored by Venetians, with the elaborate points of mimicking the dramatic arches in buildings across the canals. One of three in a series, the Lancet Shawl uses lace weight to emphasize the openwork lace motif.</p>

<p>This pattern required all 420 yards/384 meters in the skein to knit the sample shown. Plan your yarn selection accordingly.</p>

<h3 id='about_arch_shawls'>About Arch Shawls</h3>

<p>Comprised of 3 patterns, the Arch Shawls collection features stitch motifs inspired by elements of Venetian architecture. I donâ€™t claim to be an expert on architecture, but the vast buildings throughout Italy inspired me to create shawls based on the styles used in their unique structures.</p>

<p>All three shawls are single-skein projects and worked using short rows, each one making use of a cabled, lace, or textured motif.</p>

<p>Patterns may be purchased individually ($6 each) or as a set of 3 ($16).</p>
