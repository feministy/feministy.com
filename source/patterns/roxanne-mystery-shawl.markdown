"[Clues available here](http://feministy.com/patterns/roxanne/).\n\nBe sure to read each clue post very carefully, they contain all of the errata as well as notes to help you avoid a few issues that tripped people up.\n\nAll of my patterns have stories, and the Roxanne Mystery Shawl is no different. Earlier this week I watched the cinematic classic Roxanne starring Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah in their 1980s glory. I watched this at the behest of my boyfriend: the movie is one that his family loves and he grew up watching regularly. Unbeknownst to me, having never seen this film, Steve Martin has a famous line that is disgustingly cheesey and adorably romantic. When explaining to his colleague why he’s so happy and not in his usual sullen mood, he says:\n\n_“Because yesterday she doesn’t, but today she does.”_\n\nAdorable, right? And totally cheesey. But still, it’s precious and it makes the quirky comedy a little more romantic than it starts off as.\n\nThis quote embodies Roxanne Mystery Shawl and the whole concept of a mystery shawl. You start out with nothing special – a garter tab start and simple pattern set up – but you end up with something fantastic – a beautiful new pattern and the beginnings of a spunky new shawl – the next time you work on it.\n\n"
