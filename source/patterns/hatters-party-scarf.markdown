---title:Hatter's Party Scarf
---
"Inspired by the recent interest in Alice in Wonderland, Hatter’s Party Scarf is fit for a very important date!\n\nI love fringe, and I love long, triangular style scarves with a slight scoop, which is why Hatter’s Party Scarf is not a harsh triangle. Hatter’s Party Scarf is a combination of these many wonderful things, and is a great way to use one skein of colorful sock yarn, or two skeins of a luxury worsted weight.\n\nWhen knitting this scarf, I’d recommend using a slightly variegated yarn and purling the right side stitches that are in the different color (and knitting the wrong side stitches that are in the different color).\n\nKeep in mind that the stitches that fall after the marker on the right side rows (which will be before the marker on wrong side rows) should remain as written. The last 5 stitches will be dropped, and the twisted knit stitch helps to keep a nice even edge.\n\nYou can knit this scarf using any yarn weight you like, provided you have a scale or some method of estimating the remaining amount of yarn. See the information below on substitutions and changes.\n\nInstructions are included to swap out yarn weights so you can use any yarn in your stash.\n\nOriginally this pattern was only available with a Femme Fatale Fibers purchase, but I’ve made it available for purchase online due to the number of requests I’ve received for the pattern.\n\n"
