<div class="post">
  <p>You know what I&#39;m taking about here–<em>The Hunger Games</em>, <em>The Passage</em>, <em>Divergent</em>, etc. I&#39;ve learned a lot from them. Mostly, really, I&#39;ve learned that humanity is despicable and a little batty for being able to come up with these scenarios.</p>

<p>While I admit that this list is skewed toward female protagonists, some of it does apply to novels with male main characters as well.
<ol>
  <li>There will always be a girl who is just a little bit special, and she will always be torn between two worlds: the old world of her idealistic childhood, and the new world of her emerging and slowly disillusioned adulthood.</li>
  <li>That girl will <em>also</em> be torn between the love of two boys, each of which represents her place in the two worlds she is torn between.</li>
  <li>She will have to fight for her life. Physically. In a very seriously hardcore kind of way.</li>
  <li>Think of the worst thing that could happen to you or your family. And then think of the worst thing that could happen to you or your family at the hands of a tyrannical government. Take both of those ideas and combine them, and add some special ability that sets her apart from everyone else and allows her to see inside of–and potentially take down–said regime.</li>
  <li>She will lock up all of her feelings inside to the point where you want to shake her out of it. Of course, she does this to protect herself and her family.</li>
  <li>Despite the vicious battles and harsh life circumstances, she will be gorgeous and have perfect hair that is somehow never tangled.</li>
  <li>She will have an obscene will to live and desire to protect her family or partner, no matter how badly they have wronged her.</li>
  <li>Initially, she may be timid and feel powerless. But after a strapping young man sets her right and explains to her that she a bad ass and was put on this earth to destroy the government, she shapes right up and suddenly becomes a perfect soldier (likely with better abs than me) almost overnight.</li>
  <li>She never does the wrong thing.She is always right about how to win the battle.</li>
</ol>
