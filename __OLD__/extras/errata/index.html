    Wherever it says "rhn", it should actually read "lhn" - this is in the description for all the bind-offs in rows 4 (left leaf) and 9 (right leaf).

  <dd>
    Custom sizing instructions.<br>
    In the written directions, it says "you have used 1/2 your yarn" and instructs you to begin decreases. However, if you are following the schematic you will see that decreases begin after you have used 72.5% of your yarn. You can start decreases anywhere in the pattern, as long as you have approximately 30% of your yarn left to complete the decrease section. (if you made an extra-large increase section, you must be sure to have the same quantity of yarn remaining that you used for the increase section).
