---title:Squish Monster Cowl of Awesomeness
---
" **Temporarily unavailable.**\n\nI like cowls, and I really like seed stitch. About 2 years ago I bought one of those enormous infinity cowls. It’s made out of fine jersey knit fabric and layers on itself really nicely. It’s not all that warm, but it’s really versatile and goes with everything. Since then, I’ve been a bit obsessed with infinity cowls. I don’t really like wee cowls, but I love long ones that can be doubled up.\n\nI knit this cowl on a flight from Chicago to Denver in approximately 2 hours. It’s fantastically fast, and it’s also super warm. It’s one instance when bulky yarn does exactly what it should: keeps you warm without making you look like a linebacker.\n\nSure, I could have knit this cowl in the round. But honestly, who wants to deal with a hugely long US 17 circular needle? It’s already so large as to be unmanageable. Plus, knit flat, you can swap out any yarn you want and it’s a lot easier to adjust the circumference.\n\nThe Squish Monster Cowl of Awesomeness is knit entirely in seed stitch, making it 100% reversible. There’s nothing better than a reversible infinity cowl if you ask me.\n\nSo here’s a freebie pattern. This is one of my favorite things to gift and knit. Everyone I’ve shown it to oohs and ahhs over it. If you can’t grab super bulky yarn, knock this out with some scraps held double or triple. It’s a super quick knit and ideal for gifting. Enjoy!\n\n"
