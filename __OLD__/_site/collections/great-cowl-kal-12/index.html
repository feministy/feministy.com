<p><p>Honeycomb cables and textures come together with bright, vibrant yarn to make a cowl that is just as emblematic of spring as the flowers and buzzing bees enjoying them.</p>

<p>I wanted a cheery cowl that I could wear in the mornings to help stave off the chill that wasn’t too heavy. This delightful DK weight is bouncy and soft, perfect for a spring knit.</p>

<p>Although the cable pattern and smocking may present a challenge for beginning knitters, its repetitive nature is a great way to become an expert at cables in one project. A cable need is required, as the smocking is (probably) impossible without one.</p>

<p>I had this crazy idea. It was my first winter in Chicago and I decided to knit myself as many cowls as humanly possible. I challenged myself to knit and design as many as possible so that I could share the fun and do a KAL with my group. Each pattern is designed to build upon a foundation of skills, increasing in complexity (but not difficulty) the further you get into the challenge.</p>

<p>I challenged knitters to complete 5 patterns in 50 days. Everyone had to submit a photo as proof of their completed project, and each knitter who submitted received the next pattern in the series for free. Flurries Cowl received over 500 submissions, and the final cowl received about 100. Approximately 100 knitters completed all 5 patterns in 50 days.</p>

<p>Each pattern in The Great Cowl KAL 2012 is available individually ($6), or in a collection of all 5 patterns ($24). This collection includes:</p>

<p><p>Overzied puffy coats are a new thing for me. I’ve never had to bother zipping a coat all the way up to my nose. I’ve also never had to deal with my nose leaking, and then freezing on my face. Solution? A super tall, super warm, super quick cowl that stands up on its own. This cowl is perpetually, persistently, unnecessarily warm.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a secret that I am a bit of a lazy knitter and that I get bored easily. I love patterns that I can finish quickly, but keep me entertained while I am knitting them. Perpetually Persistent Cowl fits the bill with fun, but easy to memorize, cables and only 90 yards/82 m of yarn to work with!</p>

<p><p>Scarf + cowl = scowl. I really like infinity cowls, and I also love unnecessarily long scarves. Who says you can’t have both? Knit flat, this scarf features optional buttons, allowing it to be wrapped up and worn as a cowl. This clever little project incorporates textured motifs to bring out the tonal colors in semi-solid yarns without obscuring them. Add some versatility to your wardrobe with the multi-purpose project!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The 1×1 ribbing and the 2×2 ribbing will want to block out at different widths. Block your scowl according to the 1×1 ribbing: this will leave your 2×2 ribbed edge a little relaxed.</p>

<p><p>Knitting in the round makes me really happy, and I love cowls. The short rows add a little spice–and shape–to an otherwise simple pattern. Because it is worked in stockinette and garter stitch, this pattern is great at showing off hand painted or variegated yarns. The easy in-the-round construction makes it easy to adapt in different yarn weights or finished sizes.</p>

<p><p>When I was younger, Alice in Wonderland was one of my favorite stories. I obsessively read the novel and begged my mother to decorate my room in an Alice motif (she did, which resulted in endless nightmares about falling down rabbit holes and becoming sick from magical cookies).</p>

<p>The resurgence in Alice in Wonderland remakes has made me a very happy person. When given the chance to knit a cowl for the mystical Caterpillar himself, I jumped at it. The two stitch patterns fold into each other, one featuring whole, complete diamonds, and the other appearing to be leaves with little caterpillar bites taken out of them.</p>

<h3 id='about_the_great_cowl_kal_2012'>About The Great Cowl KAL 2012</h3>

<p>I had this crazy idea. It was my first winter in Chicago and I decided to knit myself as many cowls as humanly possible. I challenged myself to knit and design as many as possible so that I could share the fun and do a KAL with my group. Each pattern is designed to build upon a foundation of skills, increasing in complexity (but not difficulty) the further you get into the challenge.</p>

<p>I challenged knitters to complete 5 patterns in 50 days. Everyone had to submit a photo as proof of their completed project, and each knitter who submitted received the next pattern in the series for free. Flurries Cowl received over 500 submissions, and the final cowl received about 100. Approximately 100 knitters completed all 5 patterns in 50 days.</p>

<p>Each pattern in The Great Cowl KAL 2012 is available individually ($6), or in a collection of all 5 patterns ($24). This collection includes:</p>
