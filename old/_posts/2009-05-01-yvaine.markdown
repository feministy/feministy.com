<p>Yvaine is a triangular shawl, which is knit from the top to the bottom point with increases on every right side row. I was able to knit the shawl using the row combinations below using one ball of Handmaiden Fine Yarns Casbah Sock.</p>

<p>It’s a very simple construction: garter stitch border, 3 panels of seed stitch, and ending in garter stitch. I suppose you could just use garter stitch throughout, but I opted for seed stitch to give it a slightly more subtle texture than garter stitch usually provides. I blocked my shawl, and it nearly doubled in size. Blocking is, of course, optional with a project like this, but I’d recommend it.</p>

<p>This is a great portable project. It was one of those things I could just put down and do whatever, whenever. I finished it rather quickly, considering its size. Finished measurements after block were 45″ wingspan, and 20″ from cast on edge to bottom tip.</p>

<p>This shawl is named after Yvaine, the star from Neil Gaiman’s novel Stardust. I felt it was an appropriate name for the pattern.</p>
