---title:very pdx hat
---
"very pdx hat was inspired by one of my favorite knit hats that just didn’t fit quite right. It didn’t fit _anyone_ right, really. Whoops.\n\nThe standard instructions for very pdx hat are written for me (a women’s small), but come with an option to customize for the following sizes:\n\n- Infant, 0-6 months (13” / 33 cm)\n- Toddler, 6-18 months (15” / 38 cm)\n- Child’s small (17” / 43 cm)\n- Child’s medium (20” / 51 cm)\n- Child’s large (21” / 53 cm)\n- Women’s small (21” / 53 cm)\n- Women’s medium (22” / 56 cm)\n- Women’s large (23” / 58 cm)\n- Men’s small (22” / 56 cm)\n- Men’s medium (23” / 58 cm)\n- Men’s large (25” / 63.5 cm)\n\nThe customized versions of the pattern **are automatically generated by a computer** , not by a human. Although, since I am a human who knits, and I programmed the computer, I suppose, in a round about way, they were kinda sorta written by a human.\n\nIf you find any errors in the sizing, yardage, or instructions for the custom options (you shouldn’t - they’ve all been checked!), _be sure to include information about which size you’re knitting_ when requesting help or submitting the error. Computers are stupid after all :)\n\n* * *\n\nFound an error? Leave a comment!
