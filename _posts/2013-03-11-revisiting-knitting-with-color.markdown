In case my recent flurry of hat knitting didn't give it away, I've become a bit obsessed with working color into my knitting. I've never been big on color work, whether it be fair isle, intarsia, or simple stripes. The end result usually never matches up with what I was hoping for, and it's a too tedious to work on something so involved when the results aren't stunning. I don't really design with color, but that's because it's not my strong suit. Maybe it's not my strong suit because I don't like knitting color work very much?

Either way, color work has not really been a big component of my knitting until recently when I knit my <a title="An army of hats" href="http://feministy.com/blog/an-army-of-hats/">army of hats</a>. But now I'm super into color. I'm finishing up my last hat for awhile, and am starting to work on cowls and scarves again now that spring is slowly on its way.

Some items on my to do list - or, really, my "to want to do" list - include:
