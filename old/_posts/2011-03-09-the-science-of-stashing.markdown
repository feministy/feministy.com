There are people who do not have a stash. These people amaze me. They buy yarn for specific project(s) and begin working on them immediately. I suffer from Stash Engorgement Syndrome, although my symptoms have recently become less severe.

I recently moved and had to pack up my precious stash. My boyfriend and I lived in a smaller one bedroom apartment packed to the gills with lots of stuff. As a result, most of my stash was not readily accessible. I kept it sealed away somewhere safe. To make myself feel better about this, I used my stash as artwork, creating color coordinated displays in the living and dining rooms (which, really, were the same tiny room).

My buying habits have changed recently. Now when I buy yarn, I do it knowing that I will be knitting a specific project with it. Even if I don't complete that project or I change my mind, I still do not allow myself to buy yarn without first selecting a project. So far, this has helped me to slim down my stash and only enhance it when I don't have a suitable yarn for a project.

Conveniently, my gaining self control over my yarn buying habits coincided with my being forced to work part time rather than full time, thus having almost zero extemporaneous spending money. Thank you, economy for rendering my double BA and my master's degree both useless.

But <em>before</em> I gained this self control, I would buy yarn at a frightening rate. After knitting for a year, I had enough sock yarn (just sock yarn, mind you) to knit one pair of socks a month for 5 years and not run out. That's 60 skeins of sock yarn, a little more than one skein per week. That's some serious shopping. At the time, I was working full time at a benefited position and had a budget that allowed me to spend and save in much more comfortable ways.

Which brings me to...
<h1>The Science of Stashing</h1>
<h3><em>Yes, it's a real science.</em></h3>
Many knitters (formerly myself included) will buy beautiful yarn from independent dyers with no project in mind. Part of the draw of independent dyers is the rarity of their colorways and the unique nature of their yarns. Because this yarn is so rare, so precious, it becomes a coveted item in your stash.

You love it. You may even pet it and glance at it with impure intentions of never knitting it.

So, you don't want to use this beautiful yarn that you waited so long to snag. Instead, you stash it. You keep it for <em>just the right project</em>. And who knows, that project could come along someday. But who are we kidding? It's not likely.

The longer the yarn stays in your stash, the less likely you are to knit it. It's older now, it no longer has the lustful, shiny, newness it had when it first arrived in your mailbox. It's also even more coveted. Perhaps the dyer stopped carrying that colorway? Or maybe the dyer went out of business?

You continue to love this yarn, but yet you never knit from it. Probably because (if you're like me) you already have more knitted items than you can count and you don't want to give away your <em>My Precious</em> (nerdy Lord the Rings moment there...) yarn to someone who won't love it as much as you.

And the next thing you know, you're buying another skein of yarn. Maybe you'll knit with this one, maybe you won't. Sometimes they're one of a kind. And what if you knit the wrong project? What if you accidentally felt the socks? What if you frog it too many times and ruin the yarn? <strong>SO MUCH PRESSURE</strong>.

Stashing is a science, really. Carefully thought out, but seldom actually planned.

And this, dear knitters, is what goes through my head every time I try to knit with that extra special skein of yarn I know the yarnie will never dye again and that I'll never be able to do justice.

I have no advice for you if you're in the same predicament.

Screaming "JUST KNIT IT ALREADY!" at me and shaking me back into reality won't help either.

People have tried...

(The yarn above is one example of my stashing habits. It's from Stitches West. <em>2010</em>. It's not a particularly soft base, and I'm not in the love with the way it feels. But the <em>color</em>. What could I possibly do with that yarn?)
