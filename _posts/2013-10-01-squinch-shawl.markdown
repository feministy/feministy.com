<p>Squinch Shawl is modeled after the curious squinch arches used in buildings with domes. The tiny triangles hold up each vast roof, a centuries old marvel of engineering. Paried with garter stitch, this reversible stitch pattern makes excellent use of both lace and texture.</p>

<p>Although official instructions are only provided for one size, this pattern can also be made with worsted weight yarn. You will need approximately 380 yds/347 m of worsted weight yarn at a gauge of 15 sts and 24 rows per 4&#8221;/10cm (use whatever needle gets you this gauge). I recommend a true worsted weight, not a light worsted weight.</p>

<h3 id='about_arch_shawls'>About Arch Shawls</h3>

<p>Comprised of 3 patterns, the Arch Shawls collection features stitch motifs inspired by elements of Venetian architecture. I donâ€™t claim to be an expert on architecture, but the vast buildings throughout Italy inspired me to create shawls based on the styles used in their unique structures.</p>

<p>All three shawls are single-skein projects and worked using short rows, each one making use of a cabled, lace, or textured motif.</p>

<p>Patterns may be purchased individually ($6 each) or as a set of 3 ($16).</p>
