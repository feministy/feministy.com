<p>Honeycomb cables and textures come together with bright, vibrant yarn to make a cowl that is just as emblematic of spring as the flowers and buzzing bees enjoying them.</p>

<p>I wanted a cheery cowl that I could wear in the mornings to help stave off the chill that wasnâ€™t too heavy. This delightful DK weight is bouncy and soft, perfect for a spring knit.</p>

<p>Although the cable pattern and smocking may present a challenge for beginning knitters, its repetitive nature is a great way to become an expert at cables in one project. A cable need is required, as the smocking is (probably) impossible without one.</p>

<h3 id='about_the_great_cowl_kal_2012'>About The Great Cowl KAL 2012</h3>

<p>I had this crazy idea. It was my first winter in Chicago and I decided to knit myself as many cowls as humanly possible. I challenged myself to knit and design as many as possible so that I could share the fun and do a KAL with my group. Each pattern is designed to build upon a foundation of skills, increasing in complexity (but not difficulty) the further you get into the challenge.</p>

<p>I challenged knitters to complete 5 patterns in 50 days. Everyone had to submit a photo as proof of their completed project, and each knitter who submitted received the next pattern in the series for free. Flurries Cowl received over 500 submissions, and the final cowl received about 100. Approximately 100 knitters completed all 5 patterns in 50 days.</p>

<p>Each pattern in The Great Cowl KAL 2012 is available individually ($6), or in a collection of all 5 patterns ($24). This collection includes:</p>
