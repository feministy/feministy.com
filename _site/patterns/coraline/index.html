      <h1>Coraline</h1>

<p>
I didn’t make a PDF for this pattern because it’s not anything overly complicated. It’s really just guidelines for making jogless stripes and using scrap yarns to your advantage. But I still wanted to release something on it because Coraline is such an adorable book (and movie). I selected the dark blue and bright yellow for the main and contrasting colors because it reminded me of her hair and raincoat and boots in the film.
</p>

<p>
This is a sock I think Coraline would wear. She’s a resourceful girl who isn’t afraid of adventures. She’s smart, witty, and brave. If Coraline were a knitter, I think she’d definitely find uses for all of her scrap yarn and make something more beautiful than this.
</p>
<p>
I thought about knitting jacquard stars onto the socks, but I remembered Coraline’s striped socks from the film, so I went with stripes instead. A lot easier if you ask me!
</p>
<p>
Coraline sock This sock is officially endorsed by my black cat as an authentic Coraline-esque piece of footwear.he was not available for photos, so you’ll have to settle for my other cat loving it up.
</p>
<p>
I recently purchased a set of five 100 yard mini skeins of semi-solids with the intention that I would knit a lovely pair of Fair Isle socks, but I decided to knit something stripey instead.
</p>
<p>
I’m a sucker for rainbows – I just love the colors and they way they look together, especially when I can get some dark and light variations in there. And honestly, I cut out 3 other colors I wanted to include in the stripes because thinking about all those ends was giving me a bit of a migraine.
</p>
<p>
Each stripe used about 1 gram of yarn. For the colors that have two stripes, I used less than 1.5 grams of each total. This is an excellent way to use up sock yarn scraps if you can’t commit to making a blanket.
</p>
<p>
The sock is taller than Monkey by 1.75 inches. Because of this, I incorporated a set of decreases into the mix.
</p>
<p>
I used the <a href="http://techknitting.blogspot.com/2007/01/jogless-stripes.html">stationary jogless stripe method</a> from the ever so amazing TechKnitter in order to make my stripes perfectly lovely. And, would you believe it, I actually used DPNs for the entire sock. Underheard of, I know. I always knit Magic Loop or w/ two circular needles.
</p>
<p>
So if you’d like to knit a Coraline sock, I’ve included guidelines below. Although, I have to say my little heart would break if you knit a Coraline scrappy sock and didn’t use blue yarn for one of the main colors.
</p>
<p>
Happy knitting!

This is a sock recipe, not a pattern. If you choose to do fewer stripes, you will need additional amounts of your main color. I have included instructions for stationary jogless stripes because it is a main feature of the recipe.
</div>

<hr>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
  Using <span class="badge badge-success">CC1</span>, cast on 64 sts and join in the round, placing a stitch marker to indicate the beginning of the round. Knit in k2, p2 ribbing for approximately 12 rounds.
</p>
<p>
  Change to <span class="badge badge-success">MC</span> and knit for 2 inches. On the next round, decrease once at the beginning of each DPN by knitting two stitches together (k2tog). You now have 60 stitches. Continue in <span class="badge badge-success">MC</span> for 1 inch (3 inches total).
</p>
<p>
To obtain a rainbow striping pattern, knit these four rows in this color order: <span class="badge badge-success">CC2</span>, <span class="badge badge-success">CC3</span>, <span class="badge badge-success">CC1</span>, <span class="badge badge-success">CC4</span>, <span class="badge badge-success">CC5</span>, <span class="badge badge-success">CC6</span>, <span class="badge badge-success">MC</span>, <span class="badge badge-success">CC7</span>, <span class="badge badge-success">CC8</span>.
</p>
<p>
Switch to <span class="badge badge-success">CC</span> yarn of your choice. To obtain jogless stripes, knit the following four rows in each <span class="badge badge-success">CC</span>:
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Rounds 1, 3, 4</dt>
  <dd>k all sts</dd>
  <dt>Round 2</dt>
  <dd>slip the first stitch of the round purlwise, knit all remaining stitches</dd>
</dl>

<p>
After completing 9 stripes of 4 rows each, switch to <span class="badge badge-success">MC</span> and continue knitting for 1.5 inches.
</p>
<p>
Switch to <span class="badge badge-success">CC1</span> and knit 1 row across 30 stitches (two DPNs).
</p>
<p>
Purl one row, and begin to knit a short row heel. I did my short row heel across DPNs 4 and 1 so that the row changes would line up across the back of my calf like a seam.
</p>
<p>
Switch to <span class="badge badge-success">MC</span> and continue knitting the foot until it is approximately 2.5 inches shorter than desired length.
</p>
<p>
  Switch to <span class="badge badge-success">CC2</span> and knit 4 rows using the jogless stripe pattern above.
</p>
<p>
Switch to <span class="badge badge-success">CC3</span> and do the same.
</p>
<p>
Switch to <span class="badge badge-success">CC1</span>, knit 2 rows and then begin toe decreases. Decrease to your desired toe width (I went down to 26 stitches total) and graft.
