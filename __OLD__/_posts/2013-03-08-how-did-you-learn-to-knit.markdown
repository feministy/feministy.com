Starting with this post, I'm going to put up the occasional Q&amp;A style article featuring questions you all send to me. I get asked a lot of questions, ranging from simple (when did you start knitting?) to complex (what's your favorite yarn?). I usually answer these questions with comment replies, or in whichever venue they are presented to me. Which inevitably means that I'm answering the same question over and over again, something that's a waste of energy that I'd prefer to use on pattern releases or pattern support.

So welcome to Q&amp;A time!
<h2>How (and when) did you learn to knit?</h2>
I taught myself to knit using videos online when I was 21. Over the course of a very confusing week, I taught myself to cast on, knit, and purl.

Well... I <em>thought</em> I taught myself how to purl. It turns out that I wasn't actually purling correctly, something that took me about 6 months to figure out. I was wrapping the yarn around my needle the wrong way, creating twisted stitches that I was still knitting through the front loop.

So instead of nice, normal stockinette, I was making actually knitting twisted stockinette. I didn't really like my knitting for the first 6 months, and that totally explains why. Twisted stockinette is ugly. <em>Sadly I can't show you a picture because Flickr is being an ass and won't let me access my old photos</em>.

Everything I've learned how to do as a knitter has been totally self taught. Either through online videos, photo tutorials, or written instructions. I've never taken a class for anything.

I think being self-taught is one of the reasons why I prefer designing patterns to knitting from someone else's. I don't work as well with patterns from other designers because (typically) they're written in grotesquely huge blocks of text that I can't decipher. I have to break it down in a table or a chart, I can't follow a paragraph of text.
