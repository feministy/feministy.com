---title:My Renaissance
---
"My Renaissance is one of those designs that I thought I’d never finish. It sat around in my brain and my sketchbook, teasing me, for months. I’ve been experimenting with shawl spines and asymmetry in an attempt to design something new, something quirky, something a little bit different. When I started swatching for My Renaissance, I knew it was exactly the thing I had stuck in my brain that I couldn’t quite exorcise. And what could be a more fitting name for this shawl than My Renaissance? It truly was a knitting renaissance for me: rethinking the concept of beauty through symmetry and finding surprises in unexpected places.\n\nBecause this pattern was worked using a lighter sport weight yarn, it can also be knit using 1 skein of most fingering weight yarns.\n\nIncludes charted and written instructions for all motifs used in the pattern.\n\n#### Fingering weight information\n\nIf you choose to knit this pattern with a fingering weight yarn, your gauge and yardage requirements will be slightly different.\n\n**Gauge** : 22 sts and 29 rows per 4”/10cm, stockinette stitch   \n**Yarn** : Approximately 400-420 yards fingering weight yarn.\n\n"
