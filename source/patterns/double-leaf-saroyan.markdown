---title:Double Leaf Saroyan
---
"[Saroyan](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/saroyan) was the third pattern in a series inspired by the television show Bones. The shawl was such a big hit that when a Raveler posted modifications for a double leaf version, I compiled it into a pattern and published it with her permission. Previous patterns in the Bones series include [Traveling Woman](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/traveling-woman) and [Temperance](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/temperance).\n\nThis pattern is quite a bit more basic than the original version of Saroyan. If you’re looking for information on customizing your Double Leaf Saroyan, you will need to look at the [original version of Saroyan](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/saroyan). Information on custom sizing is not included in this pattern.\n\nDouble Leaf Saroyan contains **charts only** (no written instructions) and **is meant to serve as a modification to the original pattern rather than a stand-alone pattern.**\n\nThe sample shown is set up leaves, 12 increase leaves, 11 decrease leaves, and edge leaves and used 2 skeins Malabrigo Rios.\n\nDr. Camille Saroyan is intelligent, graceful, and uncompromisingly organized. The simple lace scarf would fit right at home in sleek and professional wardrobe.\n\nKnit in one piece from start to finish, Saroyan is a perfect project for beginning lace knitters. This tapered scarf can be worn a variety of ways, and the construction helps to keep your neck nice and cozy. The lace edging used in this scarf is from a stitch dictionary titled Super Stitches Knitting. A garter stitch border rolls over nicely, so you only see the stocking stitch body and lovely lace edging. (This rolling can be prevented if desired.)\n\nMuch like Traveling Woman, this pattern is easily adjusted to your preference. Like the triangular shawl shape instead? Simply knit more repeats of the increase section, and then begin your decreases immediately. Prefer fingering weight yarn? Bust out your scale and weigh your yarn periodically.\n\nDon’t be afraid to be bold with this pattern. It can be knit in almost any yarn weight in practically any size. The increase, decrease, and straight sections are designed so that they can be easily added or subtracted to the pattern.\n\n* * *\n\nPublished in conjunction with [ShinKitten](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/traveling-woman) (Teri).\n\n* * *\n\n**Errata**\n\nCurrent version: 2\n\n(1) For pages 3/4 (charts): Wherever it says “rhn” in the symbol descriptions, it should actually read “lhn” - this is in the description for all the bind-offs in rows 4 (left leaf) and 9 (right leaf).\n\n(2) Edge leaf instructions:\n\nRow 16 should read: bo4, k2, slm, p1, remove m, k2, p10.\n\nRow 19 should read: k1, ssk, k3, k2tog, k1, k2tog.\n\n"
