"Both the scarf and cowl are knit in the round and feature a reversible stitch motif. The scarf includes edge stitches, which are later dropped and cut open to create fringe. If youâ€™re not a fan of fringe, you can work the scarf flat back-and-forth, but you will need to ad- just the stitch motif for right side/wrong side knitting.\n\nInstructions are provided in one size for the scarf and two for the cowl: regular (pictured) and infinity. To adjust sizing or use a different yarn weight, change your cast on number to be a multiple of 21, taking care to end your project on Row 10 or 20 of the chart. No border stitches are required: the finished object will not curl up.\n\n_This pattern has not been tech edited._\n\n**Update! Now available as a Ravelry download :)**\n\n"
