---title:Triptych Shawl
---
"I&nbsp;have a love/hate relationship with beads, and I decided there had to be a way to use beads as a mild accent, with an option to add more, that wouldn’t make your neck freeze. Here it is: a shawl with beads on the emphasized edging, and that’s it. The light, breezy stitch motif is perfect for summer knitting, and is easily worked without beads.\n\nKnit from tip-to-tip, this scarf is intentionally asymmetrical. It is worked with increase, straight, and decrease sections.\n\nYou can place additional beads at your discretion, you will need approximately 14 grams of size 6 glass beads to place all of the beads listed in the pattern.\n\nThe pattern is written in a table format, with each column divider representing a marker (markers are still written intro the instructions as a friendly reminder).\n\nIf you’re new to knitting with beads, an excellent beading tutorial is available in the [Spring 2006 edition of Knitty](http://knitty.com/ISSUEspring06/FEATseducedbybeads.html).\n\n"
