<div class="post">
  <p>I was reading a book review today that was lamenting about how hesitant the reviewer was to read books recommended to her because of how few books she would read in her life. I scoffed, but then I thought about it. How many books will I really read in my lifetime?</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost impossible to answer, especially given the freakish quantity of books I read in my youth. In junior high, our &quot;literary arts&quot; teacher required us to read 3 books a month. We had to log them and submit the list with a parent&#39;s signature. Every month I would submit between 30-50 books (insane, I know). I really liked the Baby Sitters Club, and I didn&#39;t play sports. I had a lot of short books, a lot of libraries, and tons of free time on my hands after I finished homework. I didn&#39;t really watch TV, I was a bookworm: if I wasn&#39;t reading, I was doing something that actively prevented it. I even tried to read in the shower, which, shockingly, doesn&#39;t really work.</p>

<p>Anyways. The point is: <strong>how many books can I really read in my <em>adult</em> lifetime?</strong></p>

<p>If I consider &quot;adult&quot; to be age 18 and up, then I&#39;d estimate that I&#39;ll have about 50 or so good, solid years of adult reading. That will get me to 68, at which point I hesitate to speculate about my potential reading abilities or health.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">50 years @ 1 book per week is</h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><em>2,600 books in my lifetime</em></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">That is <em>not enough books</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#39;s very obvious that I am a voracious reader, but I don&#39;t always read the best books. After doing this math, I promptly went through my <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1162141?shelf=to-read">&quot;to read&quot; list</a> on Goodreads and started slimming it down. I&#39;m still at about 150, and I&#39;m a little behind on my goal of one book per week for the year: it&#39;s week 32, and I&#39;ve read 24 books. Much of that is due to listening to audiobooks during my commute and knitting, rather than reading on my Kindle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But what about knitting!? There is no way that I can finish a project a week, and knitting for 50 years seems a little daunting. I&#39;ve only been knitting since I was about 22, so I only have a few years under my belt. While I am a very fast knitter, I don&#39;t always have time to work on my projects. This is partly because of my job, but also partly because I spend a lot of time coordinating my design work instead of actually knitting. But still, over the course of the year, I usually manage to finish anywhere from 12-15 projects. I&#39;m pretty proud of that. This year I haven&#39;t finished even close to what I should, but I have been doing a lot more behind-the-scenes work than in previous years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So starting from now, at age 26, if I knit for 50 years, that would put me at 76. If I&#39;m honest with myself, I probably won&#39;t make it to 50 years of knitting: I already have troublesome joints and I don&#39;t foresee them getting any better. So lets go with 40 years of knitting, just to be safe, and 13.5 projects a year because I want to be right in the middle of my estimate.</p></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">40 years @ 13.5 projects per year is</h3>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">540 completed knitting projects</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>That's... a lot.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">2,600 and 540 are vastly different numbers. I'm worried that 2,600 books won't be enough, but I can't even think of 540 projects that I would want to knit.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe it's the concept of completion that is the issue? When I am reading a book I don't like, I stop. I put it away, never to be finished again. But when I'm knitting a project I don't like, I rarely frog it. It will sit for years (as several projects already have), and I'll be hesitant to frog it. I have a sweater that is <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/feministy/vine-yoke-cardigan">vastly too large</a> for me that I absolutely detest, but I love the yarn and can't make myself frog it for some reason.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe it has something to do with fashion? A big part of the reason I enjoy knitting so much is that it gives me the ability to sculpt my own style and play with current fashion trends. Maybe I'm daunted by 540 projects because I can't think of 540 different ways I want to shape my knitting, for myself or for others.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Or, if I take the number of projects knit in 2009–a whopping 58–the number is even more terrifying: 2,320 completed knitting projects. Even with the 29 I finished in 2010 as a standard, it's 1,160 projects.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">And after all this math, I did realize one happy thing:</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><em>My stash will not outlive me.</em></h1>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>I will be able to knit through my entire stash in my lifetime.</em></h3>
