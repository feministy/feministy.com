<p>All of my patterns have stories, and the Roxanne Mystery Shawl is no different. Earlier this week I watched the cinematic classic Roxanne starring Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah in their 1980s glory. I watched this at the behest of my boyfriend: the movie is one that his family loves and he grew up watching regularly. Unbeknownst to me, having never seen this film, Steve Martin has a famous line that is disgustingly cheesey and adorably romantic. When explaining to his colleague why he’s so happy and not in his usual sullen mood, he says:</p>

<p><em>“Because yesterday she doesn’t, but today she does.”</em></p>

<p>Adorable, right? And totally cheesey. But still, it’s precious and it makes the quirky comedy a little more romantic than it starts off as.</p>

<p>This quote embodies Roxanne Mystery Shawl and the whole concept of a mystery shawl. You start out with nothing special – a garter tab start and simple pattern set up – but you end up with something fantastic – a beautiful new pattern and the beginnings of a spunky new shawl – the next time you work on it.</p>
