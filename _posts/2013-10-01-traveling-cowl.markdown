<p>I have a secret love for cowls: they combine knitting the round, miles of stockinette, and warm, cozy comfort into one fantastically quick project.</p>

<p>Of all of the projects in the Traveling Woman Collection, Traveling Cowl is the quickest and easiest to customize. The pattern includes instructions for fingering and worsted weight yarns, both of which have a large and small size. If stockinette stitch is not your thing, I provide instructions for knitting the cowl all in lace without the stockinette stitch. The pattern is written in the round with additional instructions included for working the cowl flat with buttonholes.</p>

<p>Knit in the round or knit flat, your choice. Options to work the cowl entirely in lace or to add some emphasis to the lace pattern. Includes both charted and written lace instructions. The cowl comes in four different options depending on your yarn and cowl preference. If you prefer loose cowls, both large sizes are knit at a looser gauge, allowing the cowl to gently fall down your neck. The small/snug cowls are knit at a tighter gauge to allow for more sturdy construction. The larger cowls emphasize the lace, while the smaller cowls are built for warmth. Your choice of fingering weight or worsted weight, with a bonus bulky verion.</p>

<p>The lace motif is charted and written.</p>

<p>Customizations include instructions for additional yarn weights and an all-lace cowl. You should be familiar with knitting in the round or attaching buttons.</p>
