<p>I am a mass consumer when it comes to popular culture. I love taking it in, critiquing it, and, well, mocking it endlessly. Rock of Love Bus, anyone?</p>

<p>But more to the point: I get inspired by the characters I read about, or watch on film and television, and I decided to knit things that I think would suit them.</p>

<p>Most recently, I read a “revision” of <em>King Lear</em> and portrayed his already wicked daughters, Goneril and Reagan, in an even more amusing and delightfully dastardly light. In honor of these two wicked women, I present to you sister socks. Somewhat similar but not identical, these socks are like any set of sisters: built from the same cloth, but different and unique in their own way.</p>

<p>Both socks come in three sizes, with each sock having its own charts and set of instructions. This stitch pattern is very stretchy, and I have provided photos of the socks on both blockers and feet so you may better select a size.</p>

<p>You can purchase the set of sister socks together on Ravelry for $6 – that’s right, <em>two patterns with three sizes each for $6</em>.</p>

<h4 id='about_the_sisters'>About the Sisters</h4>

<p><strong>Goneril</strong></p>

<p>Goneril is the eldest daughter of King Lear and the Duchess of Albany. While many of you probably know her from your encounters with William Shakepeare&#8217;s play <em>King Lear</em>, this pattern is not inspired by that Goneril. No, in fact, this pattern was inspired by a different Goneril: the Goneril in Christopher Moore&#8217;s <em>Fool</em>. She&#8217;s a little bit naughty, and quite a bit greedy. If Goneril could knit, she&#8217;s the kind of woman who&#8217;d definitely keep these socks for herself.</p>

<p><strong>Regan</strong></p>

<p>Regan is the second daughter of the same King Lear, and is Duchess of Cornwall. This Regan is also not the one you are familiar with from Shakespeare&#8217;s grand production. The Regan from Christopher Moore&#8217;s <em>Fool</em> is a cruel, sadistic, and selfish woman. If Reagan could knit… well, let&#8217;s be honest, Regan would never knit. But she wouldn&#8217;t be shy about using knitting needles to stab her enemies or in some other illicit manner.</p>
