      <h1>
  Building a website with the Ravelry API
</h1>

<p class="text-success">
  A caveat about this tutorial: This isn't a "welcome to web development, this is how you do everything" type tutorial. I'm assuming that you know how to work with Ruby and are familiar with Github, the command line, APIs, JSON, HTML, CSS/Sass, and JavaScript. If any of those things are unfamiliar, you may not be able to follow all of this.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  All of the information you see about the patterns on this website (photos, text, etc) has been pulled directly from Ravelry using the API.
</p>

<p>
  I, personally, think that hitting an API with every page load is a little silly when the data is mostly consistent. I'm not getting data that changes willy nilly. I'm getting *my* data from Ravelry. It's data that, for the most part, I control.
</p>

<p>
  The advantages to this are numerous:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>I can use a static site generator to serve up all my content, like <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> or <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> (I use Jekyll), instead of running something on a server and using a database</li>
  <li>It is way cheaper (potentially free) to host as a result of above. I host my site for free using Github</li>
  <li>I can write an automated script to fetch info from the API - it can run every X hours, or I can run it manually anytime I make updates to Ravelry (I haven't done this, but the point is that I *can* do this)</li>
  <li>I have time to adjust to API changes</li>
  <li>I control when my data is updated, not my user</li>
  <li>It doesn't add an extra load onto Ravelry's already very busy servers</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The only real downside is that I have to make a choice about how my data is updated. If I have a cron job that runs every X hours, I have to keep an eye on the API documentation and make sure nothing changes. If I decide to manually run the script that updates, I'm less susceptible to changes in the API, but I also have to run it manually. Given the frequency with which I update my patterns, that's totally fine with me.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>How I did it</h3>

<p>
  The things I used to build this site are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Github for version control</li>
  <li>Hosting for free by Github pages</li>
  <li>Jekyll for static site generation</li>
  <li>Ravelry API for data</li>
  <li>Several Ruby Gems to access the Ravelry API</li>
  <li>Twitter Bootstrap (modals, layout, basic styling)</li>
  <li>TypeKit for fonts</li>
</ul>

<p>
  All of the data comes from the pattern pages on Ravelry. You access this information through the API using the pattern ID from the Ravelry database. While you can search for the pattern by name using the API, the ID is much more efficient and you're guaranteed to get the correct pattern every time. The Ravelry API has no limits, so you can call on it for every page load if you wanted to and it wouldn't make too much of a difference. I don't do it that way: I make a series of batch calls to the API to get the initial data, and then I run updates periodically.
</p>

<h4>Step 1: getting the pattern ID</h4>
<p class="well well-small pull-right">
  If you have a lot of patterns, you may want to consider writing a
  <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank">Selenium</a><br>
  driver that grabs the IDs and drops them into a yml file for you.
</p>

<p>
  Navigate to a pattern page in Ravelry and open up the JavaScript console. Type this in: <code>$$('.difficulty').first().id</code>.
</p>

<p>
  You should see something like this: <code>"pattern_419443_difficulty_score"</code>.
</p>

<p>
  You'll want to add that number (<code>419443</code>) to an array or whatever other mechanism you're using to process your API call.
</p>

<h4>Step 2: figuring out what to do with your data</h4>

<p>
  My site is rendered entirely by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. This means that all I had to do for each pattern was create a Markdown file with the necessary information in the YML front matter. I have a <i>ton</i> of information that I want to display, so my YML is pretty intense. Beneath the YML is the formatted pattern description from Ravelry.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/feministy/a8d2d8d82bdda63ec00e.js"></script>

<p>
  For every key in my YML ("title", "price", etc), there is a value assigned to it. Some of those values are arrays that I can iterate over, so I can store more information attached to one key. The big benefit of this is that I know that all of my images are in one place in the exact order they appear on Ravelry.
</p>

<p>
  Because I am using Jekyll, I also have a layout that uses these variables. It is pattern specific, so it doesn't confuse my blog posts or anything like that.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/feministy/2e63e85b4ed8be147914.js"></script>

<h4>Step 3: calling on the API</h4>

<p>
  Ok, so I'm cheating a little here. The Ravelry API requires authentication with HTTP Basic Auth. You can use Ruby's Net:HTTP to complete these calls, but I had some trouble getting authorization to go through smoothly. Instead, I am using a <a href="https://github.com/taf2/curb" target="_blank">gem</a> that uses libcurl.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/feministy/0c75132aa8ff15dabb03.js"></script>

<p>
  For every key that I have in my YML front matter (above), there is a method in my API call that gets the data. Here are some samples of the different methods I have.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/feministy/e46cd0b933dafceef2d2.js"></script>

<p>
  I also have an entirely separate system for creating collection pages based on the information returned in the initial pattern API calls. Much of the content generated there is done in the same way: key/value pairs and static text/html/markdown.
</p>

<p>
  So that is how it is done. I am currently in the process of writing a script that will run once every 24hrs. It will make an API call, update the files, push them to Github, and upload them to my site so the changes are live. Eventually, I will be able to manually trigger an update for all patterns, or one specific pattern, if I so desire.
