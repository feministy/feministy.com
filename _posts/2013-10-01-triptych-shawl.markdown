<p>I have a love/hate relationship with beads, and I decided there had to be a way to use beads as a mild accent, with an option to add more, that wouldn’t make your neck freeze. Here it is: a shawl with beads on the emphasized edging, and that’s it. The light, breezy stitch motif is perfect for summer knitting, and is easily worked without beads.</p>

<p>Knit from tip-to-tip, this scarf is intentionally asymmetrical. It is worked with increase, straight, and decrease sections.</p>

<p>You can place additional beads at your discretion, you will need approximately 14 grams of size 6 glass beads to place all of the beads listed in the pattern.</p>

<p>The pattern is written in a table format, with each column divider representing a marker (markers are still written intro the instructions as a friendly reminder).</p>

<p>If you’re new to knitting with beads, an excellent beading tutorial is available in the <a href='http://knitty.com/ISSUEspring06/FEATseducedbybeads.html'>Spring 2006 edition of Knitty</a>.</p>
