Things are finally warming up here in Chicago. Not only is the weather getting warmer, but I'm getting busier and preparing to move into our new house.

I actually knit - and finished! - my very first cotton item. I know, super weird. I've been knitting for years, and have always avoided working with cotton. I would start items and never finish them out of frustration. I received a request from a yarn company to work up a design for their cotton yarn line, and I figured it was a great opportunity to knit with cotton. And now I love it!

I'm already starting to sketch out some garments perfect for cotton! I'm really into anything racerback or with one shoulder. They keep you so cool in the humidity, and are easy to cover up with a cute cardigan for wearing indoors.

Anyways! I am prepping for summer - and not just with my knits!

I got my summer hair cut:

And I've been breaking out some new summer outfits:

And I got my first pedicure of the season:

Then Colin and I made some delicious sangria for our Memorial Day barbecue:

And I've been spending quality time outside in the beautiful weather before the lake gets too crowded:

But what about knitting?

There is more of that coming soon! More new patterns, collections, and sneak peeks. We're spending the entire month of June moving into our new house and getting everything ready, but I promise I have some good stuff in store for you guys once we get settled.
