<p>This is the fourth pattern in a series inspired by characters on the television show Bones. Previous patterns include: <a href='http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/traveling-woman'>Traveling Woman</a>, <a href='http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/saroyan'>Saroyan</a>, and <a href='http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/temperance'>Temperance</a>.</p>

<p>Daisy Wick has never ending optimism, coupled with never ending energy: a dangerous combination, needless to say. The bright, feminine pink is perfect for a girl like Daisy, who thought proving that she was a woman to avoid being attacked meant stripping down to her bra and underwear.</p>

<p>The simple lace and cable ribbing provides these socks with a fair amount of stretch. Worked toe up, these socks can easily be adjusted to become knee socks or to fit a larger foot. Shown in size small.</p>

<p>This pattern is written toe-up, with instructions provided for a toe-up heel flap. Please note that this pattern is written for two circular needles and uses the abbreviation ndl1 (instep) and ndl2 (foot) to indicate this. If using DPNs, make sure you pay close attention to this. Instructions for different sizes are provided on individual pages with charts on page 6.</p>

<p>This pattern will go significantly faster if you cable without a cable needle.</p>

<p>Pattern includes the following: small (US women’s shoe 7-7.5), medium (US women’s shoe 8-8.5), large (US women’s 9-10). Each size has its own set of instructions and its own chart. Instructions are included in chart and written form for the lace portion. Toe up construction using a heel flap.</p>
