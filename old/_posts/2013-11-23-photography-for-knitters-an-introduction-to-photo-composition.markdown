<em>This is a gust post by my husband and resident photographer, Colin FitzGerald.</em>

I know that <strong>"photographic composition" </strong>sounds wordy and complicated, and it is. Sort of. While the subject of your photo matters, the composition is the difference between a bad snapshot and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Avedon" target="_blank">Richard Avedon</a> photograph. The more comfortable you are with setting up a photo, the better the photo will turn out. Everyone has their own methods, and that is something I cannot help you with. What I can do, however, is explain a few changes you can make to the way you take photos, thereby allowing you to see how a few basic principles can take a sloppy photo and force it into its tuxedo. I certainly don’t know everything, but I know what seems to work well for me. That being said, here goes:
<h2>First thing first: the Rule of Thirds.</h2>
<a href="http://feministy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/rule-of-thirds1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2522" title="rule-of-thirds" src="http://feministy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/rule-of-thirds1-350x232.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="232" /></a>This concept is famous among artists of all mediums. If you divide your image into 9 rectangles (a grid of 3x3), you are left with lines that go through it at each of its thirds – like this sample photo.

Simply put, a photo with a tree right in the center of the image is okay, but if you move that tree onto one of those third-lines, for some reason the eye finds it more inviting, more engaging. Try it out by taking a photo of your doorknob, right smack dab in the middle. Then take a photo of it again, with it off to one side. For whatever reason, that’s all it takes to make a photo look somewhat put together.

The trick is to put the subject off to one side enough that it doesn’t look accidental, but not so far that it’s bumping up against the edge of your image either. The rule of thirds is useful for both horizontal and vertical placement of a subject.
<h2>Second thing second: Be aware of your background.</h2>
<em>I have been getting questions about selecting a specific background, and will go more in-depth about them next time.</em>

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2525" title="fence-edge" src="http://feministy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fence-edge-232x350.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="350" />

If your goal is to take a photo of a black guitar, putting it in front of a black background will force you to lose some of the detail of the guitar. If you want a photo of a woman wearing a scarf, be mindful of what she’s standing near. Many amateurs take good photos of their subjects, but completely disregard everything else in the frame. Pay attention: everything you see through your camera will be in that image.
<h2>Third thing third, obviously: Light.</h2>
What a camera is at its most basic level is a light-capturing box. That being said, make sure you have enough of it when you’re shooting. The more light, the faster the shutter, and the faster the shutter, the clearer the photo. If you take photos outside, take them while being mindful of where your light (the sun) is casting shadows and highlights, and whether its a cloudy day or a bright sunny day.
<h2>Lastly: context.</h2>
Context is a finicky sort of thing, because it’s all a sort of personal choice. The easiest way to explain photographic context is with an example: if you’re shooting a woman with a heavy wool sweater, don’t put her next to a palm tree on a beach surrounded by people getting a tan. It just looks....weird. And visually confusing. The idea of basic photography is to have a situation make sense when you look at it.

Those are some basic rules of composition that should prove quite helpful. The more you pay attention to them, the easier it will be for you to rapidly and automatically put together a photo that has left your snapshots behind. It will also allow you to create your own unique style, so your mom can say “Wow, those look great”, and actually mean it.
