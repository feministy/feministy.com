Last night I sat down and realized it has been over a year since I knit something for myself from a pattern written by someone else. Which, considering that I only knit from patterns by other designers for several years, is a pretty impressive feat. I wasn't trying to do it, and I'm quite sad about it, actually.

My fingers have been itching to knit something quick, small, and fun. I made a <a href="http://brooklyntweed.net/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=2_4&amp;products_id=13" target="_blank">Turn A Square</a> for Colin a few days ago. Not only did I fail to notice that I was supposed to change needle sizes, but I also missed a round of increases as well. Whoops. I didn't particularly love the pattern, but that's because I'm not a big fan of plain hats. The decreases are absolutely fabulous, I love every single stitch of this crown.

<a href="http://feministy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-shot-2013-02-26-at-8.26.27-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4005" title="Screen shot 2013-02-26 at 8.26.27 AM" src="http://feministy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-shot-2013-02-26-at-8.26.27-AM-580x580.png" alt="" width="580" height="580" /></a>

I browsed through my stash, looking to see if there was something else that I wanted to knit with. But since I just got rid of the bulk of it, there wasn't really much that I could pull from. Lots of random sock yarn that will go into granny square blankets, but not much by way of single skein worsteds or similar.

Using my new <a title="Living life without a stash" href="http://feministy.com/blog/living-life-without-a-stash/">stash philosophy</a>, I decided I should go through my Ravelry queue and see what struck me as the perfect project. After finding a pattern I knew I had to make immediately, I took a quick jaunt over to <a href="http://www.knit1chgo.com/" target="_blank">Knit 1</a> with <a title="Knitters, meet Kiwi" href="http://feministy.com/blog/knitters-meet-kiwi/">Kiwi</a> in tow to see what they had by way of worsteds. I had my heart set on a nice gray with a little mustard for the contrast color. I ended up going with something better than mustard.

I plopped on the floor with my puppers and stared longingly at the colorful Anzula Cricket sitting on a shelf left than 10 feet away from me. I love (love, love, <em>love</em>) <a href="http://anzula.com/" target="_blank">Anzula</a> yarns. Not only are the amazing and come in great colors, but everyone on the team is amazing. I had the opportunity to meet them at Stitches West in 2012 and they're truly amazing women. So while Kiwi sat on the floor with me and lapped up the attention from all of the knitters, I stared at some yarn and headed home to cast on <a href="http://www.dull-roar.com/2011/08/hat-for-eudora.html" target="_blank">A Hat for Eudora</a>.

<a href="http://feministy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-shot-2013-02-26-at-8.24.54-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4003" title="Screen shot 2013-02-26 at 8.24.54 AM" src="http://feministy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-shot-2013-02-26-at-8.24.54-AM-580x580.png" alt="" width="580" height="580" /></a>

… which I totally, completely, and utterly failed at. First I completely missed the word "provisional," and then I cast on the wrong number of stitches. And then, if that wasn't bad enough, I realized after knitting the contrast hem that I'd been using a needle that was two sizes smaller than called for.

Whoops.

So I'm pretty much a horrible knitter. I don't read every word because I think I know what the pattern is telling me to do, so I make stupid mistakes that cause me to rip out the entire project and completely start over.

But dammit, I will have a pretty hat.
