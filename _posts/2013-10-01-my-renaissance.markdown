<p>My Renaissance is one of those designs that I thought I’d never finish. It sat around in my brain and my sketchbook, teasing me, for months. I’ve been experimenting with shawl spines and asymmetry in an attempt to design something new, something quirky, something a little bit different. When I started swatching for My Renaissance, I knew it was exactly the thing I had stuck in my brain that I couldn’t quite exorcise. And what could be a more fitting name for this shawl than My Renaissance? It truly was a knitting renaissance for me: rethinking the concept of beauty through symmetry and finding surprises in unexpected places.</p>

<p>Because this pattern was worked using a lighter sport weight yarn, it can also be knit using 1 skein of most fingering weight yarns.</p>

<p>Includes charted and written instructions for all motifs used in the pattern.</p>
