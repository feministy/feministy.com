<em>This is part of a series of articles by Colin FitzGerald on photography for knitters.</em>

A number of people have been asking questions regarding some more specific aspects of photography. I’ll go ahead and take a few to respond to them!
<h2>How do I capture intense detail in images?</h2>
This process can be a bit of a trick, and requires a combination of good light and a specialized lens called a <strong>macro</strong> lens. Nikon makes a few of these lenses, from about 40mm to about 200mm. The larger the focal length, the farther away you can be while achieving the same effect. In a studio or controllable environment, such as the ones used in knitting photography, there is no reason to spend excessive amounts of money buying the longer focal length because you can get close to your subject.

You’ll need good light, so make sure to take your photos with tons and tons of the stuff. Light room, flashlights, sunlight, flash, the works. The standard rule for light in studio photography is “the more the better.” More light means a faster shutter speed, and less micro-blur (small amounts of wind moving small threads) which results in a loss of the small details.

That, plus watching your contrast in the image will greatly increase the details your image produces. You want your contrast to be high, but not too high or you lose details. Mess around a bit and you’ll get it right.
<h2>Which should I buy: kit lenses or flashes?</h2>
Almost unanimously a lens is a better investment than a flash, especially if your style of photography is something that can be done in sunlight. Lens quality is one of the single biggest factors in image quality. Light is important, certainly, but the sun generates a large amount of that on its own, and once you get familiar with how to use natural light, a bad lens will still result in a bad photo. You can also cheat the flash aspect my using continuous light, like flashlights and halogen lamps and such.

$250 is not a lot of money, as far as DSLR investment goes, but it can get you an improvement over basic equipment, especially if you’re willing to shop around, and perhaps invest in used equipment, or sacrifice convenience things (like autofocus) that usually lenses more expensive. A good lens can stick with you through many camera bodies, if you treat them well, and can ultimately last you for decades. I still have a lens my dad purchased in 1972 and it works flawlessly. If you’re careful you might be able to get a good quality used lens for a hefty discount. Depending on your camera, this will greatly increase your image quality. Obviously you have to have a decent SLR to produce a decent image, but the easiest way to improve image quality is to upgrade past the kit-lens, so that’s where I’d start.

One thing to keep in mind: if you're not sure you're ready to take the plunge, <strong>you can rent camera equipment</strong> from many reputable dealers, both online and at brick-and-motar stores.
<h2>Why do I have trouble with reds/purples/oranges/blues? How do I make my colors look true-to-life?</h2>
Time for color balance! Color balance requires an image edit program. While you can set your white balance on most cameras to accommodate to a degree, the most accurate way there is to correct color caste is to leave the white balance on auto, and then edit it in a photo program. There are a number on the market, but the industry standards are Adobe <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Photoshop</a> or Adobe <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/" target="_blank">Lightroom</a>.

Camera sensors seem to have issues with greens and reds, so a bit of color correction is a good thing. The Adobe programs are expensive, but allow you to do a vast amount with a photo, so I feel they are a good investment. There are alternatives out there, and if all you plan on doing is correcting color-caste, they will probably do the trick. Some people use Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/" target="_blank">Aperture</a>, but I haven't taken a spin with that myself, so I can't vouch for its capabilities.
