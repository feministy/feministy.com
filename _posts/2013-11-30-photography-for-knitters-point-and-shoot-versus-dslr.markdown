<em>As I'm sure many of you know, the photography for my patterns is done by my husband, <a href="http://colinfitzgeraldphotography.com" target="_blank">Colin FitzGerald</a>. I've been pestering him to share his knowledge of photography with the knitting world in a way that makes it easier for independent designers, like myself, to create and edit their own high-quality photos without spending extraordinary amounts of money to hire a professional for each pattern. </em>

<em>In the coming weeks, you'll see posts from Colin that range from simple Photoshop tutorials to complex explanations of the inner workings of camera equipment. If you have any questions about photography or your specific camera, you can leave a comment on any of Colin's posts and he will respond. These posts are geared toward individuals with a desire to learn more about photography in general and are not necessarily specific to knitters and indie designers. Happy photographing! - Liz</em>
<h1>Point-and-Shoot versus DSLR: Advantages and Disadvantages</h1>
I think it is important to make clear the distinction between “DSLR” and “Point-and-Shoot” (P/S). DSLR stands for Digital Single Lens Reflex, and is the style of camera used by photography professionals around the world. They closely resemble the old-school film cameras, with interchangeable lenses and tons of gadgets. By comparison, P/S cameras are cheaper and compact making them the common choice for most people.
<h3>Point-and-Shoots</h3>
<strong>The general advantages of a Point-and-Shoot camera are:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Typically more affordable, with prices rarely exceeding $500.</li>
  <li>Simple by comparison: it’s one piece of equipment, as opposed to several.</li>
  <li>Compact: everything you need to take the photo comes in a package about the size of a large deck of cards. They fit in your pocket, don’t require an assistant built like a horse to accompany you, and can be easily stored.</li>
  <li>Convenient: because they are simple and compact, they are more convenient. You can take them to parties, bars, birthdays, and you wont get arrested if you pull a point and shoot camera out to take pictures of your friend’s kids at a park.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The general disadvantages of a Point-and-Shoot camera are:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Loss of control: by making all the processes of a camera automatic and user friendly, you lose the ability to control all the aspects that make a photo more than just a picture.</li>
  <li>Lower image quality: the quality of an image relies upon a few very important (and commonly more expensive) pieces of a camera. The quality of the camera’s parts in P/S cameras are sacrificed to make them more compact and cheaper, leaving you with a lower quality product.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Things to keep in mind should you choose a Point-and-Shoot camera:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>An increase in megapixels does not mean a higher quality photo: without geeking out too much, the ratio of pixels to the actual physical size of a sensor is much more important. This usually means that a 10-12 megapixel P/S camera can take better photos than a 16 megapixel camera. The actual explanation for this takes about 200 pages, and requires a lot of optical physics, so I’ll spare you and just leave it at that.</li>
  <li>Viewing screens matter: get a camera with a larger viewing screen and high resolution. It will allow you see the image you’ve just taken and to decide if you have to re-take it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>DSLR</h3>
<strong>The general advantages of a DSLR are:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Unlimited control over your equipment: with a DSLR you can choose which lens, flash and camera body to use, allowing you a much more customized setup, and thereby allowing you more control over your shooting environment.</li>
  <li>Highly versatile: as a result of the excessive number of options, a DSLR allows you to take photos in nearly every situation, which makes it easier to create professional looking photos.</li>
  <li>High quality equipment: while expensive, a DSLR is largely made of better materials and with more care. Because they are not pressured to be small and sleek, DSLRs are more basic and therefore more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The general disadvantages of a DSLR are:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Expense: for a P/S camera, you can spend $400 and then go take a photo. With a DSLR, it is not unreasonable to spend upwards of $700 just to take your first photo. If you are as nit-picky about quality as I am, expect to spend far more than $1000.</li>
  <li>Size: unless you’re entirely unconcerned about how much your day-pack weighs, the DSLR is impractical for casual use, as they are large and expensive.</li>
  <li>A steep learning curve: with so many options and settings, it can take even an avid photographer a while to become familiar with a new camera. If this is your first DSLR, expect to spend a large amount of time changing settings and retaking photos.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Things to keep in mind, should you choose a DSLR:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t over-buy: choose a camera body that matches your skills. Buying the top of the line camera will be a waste of money if you’re new to DSLRs. Many of the features you pay for will remain unused. Similarly, if you’re familiar with DSLRs, don’t buy the cheapest DSLR; you may be disappointed with what it allows you to do.</li>
  <li>Choose your lenses carefully: every lens has its specific uses, so choose a lens that suits your preferences.</li>
  <li>Consider shooting location: if you are planning on shooting outdoors, you will need to consider weather and sunlight. Indoor photos almost always require flash, because generally lights aren’t that powerful.</li>
</ul>
<h1>In summary...</h1>
Whether DSLRs or P/S cameras are your final choice, make sure you buy a camera that you are comfortable holding and using. Every camera has its own particular down-sides, and part of being comfortable with it is knowing how to work around these issues. Just as with anything, the more you use it, the better you’ll become. Remember: you get what you pay for. If you spend $175 on a camera, you will almost certainly end up with a lower quality camera than if you were spend $1000. Remember to balance how much you want to spend with how good of a final product you want and how much time you want to invest becoming familiar with your equipment.
