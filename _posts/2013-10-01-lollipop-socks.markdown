<p>I originally designed this pattern for the Woolgirl sock club back in 2010 and got distracted by shawls before I ever released it. The pattern has been completely revisited and improved somewhat to more easily convey the zig zag motif.</p>

<p>Ideally suited for those variegated yarns that none of us can resist buying, Lollipop Socks fly off the needles due to their simple ribbing. If you like the zig zag rib, you can continue the pattern along the foot instead of transitioning to 2×2 ribbing.</p>

<p>When my dad was younger, he and his two brothers dressed up as the boys from the Lollipop Guild for one Halloween. When I told him I was knitting a pattern based on the Lollipop boys, he was ecstatic: he insisted I knit a pair for him (I never did, but his excitement has never wavered even so). This wildly fun yarn stands out in this simple zig zag rib pattern.</p>

<p>The pattern is available for free and includes one size. To up or downsize the pattern, you’ll need to make adjustments to your stitch count in multiples of 4 and tinker with the heel flap as you see fit.</p>
