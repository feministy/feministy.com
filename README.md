### Hello, this is my website.

I made it using:

* Jekyll
* Ravelry API
* My pattern data in Ravelry
* Typekit for fonts
* Twitter Bootstrap for JS and layout

---

### TODO

#### Must be done before launch

* Make sure I didn't forget any other patterns
* Move blog posts over (at least the ones I want)
* Update all patterns in Ravelry
* Write about pages for me and the Ravelry API
* Figure out how to host on Github pages

#### Can be done after launch

* Update API seed file to check for updates before creating a file
* Write a script that will automatically ping the API and check for changes
* Figure out if I should swap out compiled Bootstrap CSS with personal overrides for the LESS version with variables
* Figure out deploy hook for Github pages
