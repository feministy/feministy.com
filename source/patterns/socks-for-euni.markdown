---title:Socks for Euni
---
"I had a dream I was wearing these spiral socks, and that they were lovely to knit and even more wonderful to wear. (I’m not a crazy person, I don’t normally dream about socks.) Named after my friend Eunice, these socks are sunny, fun, and a little bit odd.\n\nWhile I could have charted this pattern or written it out row by row, it’s much easier to knit this sock if you “read” your knitting rather than follow a chart. Directions are provided with pictures, but I promise you it’s easier than it looks. By providing instructions for reading your knitting, it’s much easier to customize your sock to your liking and to adjust sizes.\n\n**These socks are NOT mirror images of each other.** I _hate_ working left twist stitches :)\n\nIf you would like a pattern where the socks are mirror images of each other, please look at [Down the Rabbit-Hole by Kimberly Pieper.](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/down-the-rabbit-hole-2)\n\n"
