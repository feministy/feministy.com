Every few months or so, I'll get a random rash of messages about one specific element of my patterns. I'm not sure how it happens, but I'll get an average of 5-10 messages on a daily basis about one thing. I don't mind it. In fact, I love getting emails and messages from people who are knitting my patterns. It's really nice to talk to people who are working up my stuff. I don't get to hang out with a lot of local knitters, so I crave the connection. O please! Keep sending me messages! I love them!

But I'm getting away from the point. 

This week, the messages have been about Saroyan. I'm assuming it coincides with a group on Ravelry doing a KAL, since that's where most of the messages come from. If you're doing a KAL on Ravelry, don't be afraid to ear burn me! I will happily jump in and answer questions. Like I said: I crave the connection to my fellow knitters. 

A lot of people have some issues with the garter stitch edge curling over on their scarf. Let me first say that when I designed the scarf, I did so with the intention that the edge would roll. I wanted it to be warm and cozy. I knew that the loosely knit stockinette stitch wouldn't necessarily provide me with the warmth I was hoping for. I made the decision to work the body in stockinette stitch rather than garter stitch. You can, obviously, choose to knit the body of the scarf in garter stitch, but that doesn't answer the question or address the concern. 

The edge isn't actually what curls. If you look inside of the curl, you'll notice that the garter stitch edge is nice and flat. What's happening is the body in it's stockinette stitch massiveness is idling up around it. 

But why doesn't the other edge curl? The leaf edge doesn't curl because of a few reasons. First, a larger portion of the leaf side of the scarf contains increases and decreases. These simple stitches help to change the direction of the stockinette stitch and trick it into not turning into a tube. The straight edge is much more inclined to curl because there is nothing to stop it from doing so. All of the stitches are going in the same direction. 

A second reason is because of the leaves themselves. When the leaves are blocked out, the edges curl, but only that one edge stitch. It gives the leaves a three dimensional appearance, which I find to be a nice extra feature of the scarf. 

And finally, the third reason is how the scarf is worn. Almost everyone who wears the scarf, at least that I've seen, places the garter stitch border up around their neck and the leaves down, resting on their torso. Of course, there are several hundred million different ways to wear the scarf, and not everyone wears it that way. So this only applies to you if you wear the scarf in that manner. 

But! There are some things that will help combat this curling. While I can't change the characteristics of stockinette stitch, I can trick it into behaving nicely. In general, the more loosely you knit stockinette stitch, the easier it is to cure the curling with a good blocking. 

If loosely knit stockinette stitch is not your thing, you can also try expanding the width of the garter stitch border, or, alternatively, knitting the entire body in garter stitch. You can also try swanky things, like adding seed stitch to the body instead of solid stockinette. 

At the end of the day, though, it will curl. There's nothing I can really do about that unfortunately. I wish I could wave a magic wand and make stockinette do exactly what I wanted it to, but there's no bippity boppity boo fairy godmother magic at my disposal. 

Don't get discouraged if your scarf curls. A lot of people say "but I see pictures of everyone else's scarves and they don't curl!" Well no. Would you share a picture of your scarf curled up into a teeny tube? You're most proud of your work when it looks the best. People take pictures of FOs when they are fresh from the blocking board and in their most pristine state. I try to let my objects relax a little after being pulled off of the blocking boards to give a more realistic portrayal of how they will function on a day to day basis.
