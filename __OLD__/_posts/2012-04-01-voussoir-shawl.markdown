<p>Voussoir Shawl is modeled after the wedge-shaped bricks that fill in the gaps in archways left behind by regular, lesser bricks. The smocked cable motif stacks rows of stitches in a similar fashion, creating miniature archways of cabled stitches. Paired with ribbing, this scarf has no proper top or bottom.</p>

<h3 id='about_arch_shawls'>About Arch Shawls</h3>

<p>Comprised of 3 patterns, the Arch Shawls collection features stitch motifs inspired by elements of Venetian architecture. I donâ€™t claim to be an expert on architecture, but the vast buildings throughout Italy inspired me to create shawls based on the styles used in their unique structures.</p>

<p>All three shawls are single-skein projects and worked using short rows, each one making use of a cabled, lace, or textured motif.</p>

<p>Patterns may be purchased individually ($6 each) or as a set of 3 ($16).</p>
