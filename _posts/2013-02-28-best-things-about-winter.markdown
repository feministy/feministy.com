Winter is almost over. It's always at the end of February that I start to get exasperated by the constant cold, my running nose, and total lack of sunshine. It is times like this that I have to remind myself of a few good things about winter.

Hot cocoa and tea by the fire, and baking cookies without worrying about overheating the house.

Staying inside a ton, and appreciating city life so much more when I do go out.

A much shorter wait at all of my favorite restaurants because everyone is too cold to go outside.

Everything I knit is somehow weather-appropriate instead of being made for the wrong season.

Making snow angels.

Seeing the city from a different perspective.

Marveling at the neat things ice can do.This is totally new to me as a California girl.

Enjoying perfect curls without the frizz.

And taking advantage of the sunshine when it does come.

So I guess winter is not too bad. It's only 36 outside, with a little bit of snow coming down. The ground is a little slushy, but it makes for fun puddle jumping.

No matter how old I am, I will always love to jump in puddles.
