<p>Queen Anne is one of those women that I always knew about, but didn’t know about. Turns out she was a pretty bad ass lady. During her imprisonment, she never stopped plotting: whether it was escape, a coup, or how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, she was always at it. The stitch motif used in this shawl is reminiscent of the bars that confined her, and a garter stitch ruffle pays homage to Elizabethan fashion.</p>

<p>Babington Shawl knits up very quickly, so if you’re looking for an easy pattern that flies off the needles, this is definitely for you. It requires just a bit more than 400 yards of fingering weight yarn, and does best with yarns that have a nice drape to them or some silk content. Constructed using simple short rows without wraps, Babington Shawl is well-suited for beginners who have little experience with short rows. The lace pattern is a two-row repeat and is very easy to memorize.</p>
