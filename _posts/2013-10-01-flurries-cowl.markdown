<p>Originally the kick off pattern of The Great Cowl KAL 2012, Flurries Cowl led the charge as many crazed knitters attempted to complete 5 patterns in 50 days. Flurries Cowl is free to download.</p>

<p>Living in Chicago has taught me a lot about cold weather wear, and it’s only December. Bundling up is essential, but sometimes you overheat. This cowl is designed to combat woeful winter predicaments. A double set of buttons lets you button it loose or tight, allowing you to keep warm or stay cool and comfortable.</p>

<p>Loop it over your head to protect ears and necks from chilly breezes, or wear it cape-style under a coat to add an extra layer of warmth.</p>
