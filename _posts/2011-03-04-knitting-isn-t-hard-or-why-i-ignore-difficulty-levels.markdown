What I am about to say may shock some of you: <strong>knitting is not hard</strong>. Yes, it can be difficult to learn. And yes, it is an impossible talent to master. But knitting in itself, once you have a beginners level of understanding for the basics, is pretty simple.

You only know knitting is hard if someone tells you it is.

For example, let's examine <strong>decreases</strong>.

If you know how to knit, you know how to work a knit stitch. <em>That may sound a little redundant, but sometimes these things have to be said.</em>

Working k2tog (knit two together) is easier done than typed (mostly because you have to define your abbreviation and symbol). Instead of knitting one stitch, you knit two of them. Together. At the same time.

So, by extension, k7tog should also be easy to do. Of course, it will be a fiddly stitch to work. But it's not hard. You already have the skills and tolls necessary to perform the action.

Increases work in the same manner: if you can do one yarn over, you can do 2. If you know how to make 1 left, you can easily work that (k1, m1l) set of instructions 10 times on a row without breaking a sweat.

But what about sweaters? Sweaters are giant scarves. Some things matter more with scarves - like gauge - but if you can knit a gauge swatch, you can knit a sweater. Some patterns are easier to understand than others, but your barrier will be a poorly written pattern or a designer who uses unclear language, not the skill in and of itself.

And socks. Those persnickety little fools. What about those? Guess what? They're easy too. Scared to try picking up stitches? Knit a short row heel instead. Don't want to graft your toe together? Try toe up, or cinch your toe closed.

Lace! Lace is not hard, either. If you can't remember more than 4 stitches at a time, only work 4 stitches at a time. Hate reading from charts? Read the written instructions (although I promise charts are way easier).

I will be the first to admit that I hate color work of any kind. But it's not hard. It's fiddly, and slow, and time consuming. But you're using multiple balls of yarn in different colors to knit a piece of art. Did you honestly expect to knit 80 stitches per minute? Don't allow the speed of your work to impact your perspective or the way you come to understand the difficult of knitting patterns. It's not hard. You only know that color work is hard if someone tells you it is hard. If it's not hard if you approach it with hesitation and the expectation that you're learning a new skill - but not necessarily a difficult one.

But at the end of the day, no matter what you knit, it's all knitting. All of it. It's all the same.

Knitting is about creating loops and pulling them through loops that already exist on your needles. Knitting is about repetitive motion. Knitting is about moving the needle in a specific way. Knitting is about wrapping the yarn around your needle to form stitches. Knitting is <em>not</em> about telling yourself something can't be done. What matters most when you knit a pattern is your confidence, a well-written pattern, and the ability to knit, purl, and read instructions.

Pull that pattern out of your queue and DO IT. It'll be slow starting, but I promise you can do it. Without tears.

And if you can't? Just frog it.
