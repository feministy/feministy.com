"ribbing transitions into colorwork with this simple unisex hat. great for using scraps and an easy introduction to stranded colorwork with some longer floats.\n\nas written, fits women’s medium loosely (21”/53cm), or men’s medium snugly (23”/58 cm).\n\n**sizing up or down**\n\nsimply add or subtract 7 from your cast on number to make the hat larger or smaller.\n\nthe decreases are too many rows for baby hats, but you should be able to work anywhere from toddler to a large men’s size without adjustments to the decreases.\n\n**a note on gauge**\n\ngauge is not critical for this project. use the best needle for working with your worsted weight yarn. stitches should be lofty, not too tight.\n\n_if you were one of the two people who downloaded this before i uploaded the corrected ribbing, i fixed it :)_\n\n"
