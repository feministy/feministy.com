"Saroyan is the third pattern in a series inspired by the television show Bones. Previous patterns include [Traveling Woman](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/traveling-woman) and [Temperance](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/temperance).\n\nDr. Camille Saroyan is intelligent, graceful, and uncompromisingly organized. The simple lace scarf would fit right at home in sleek and professional wardrobe.\n\nKnit in one piece from start to finish, Saroyan is a perfect project for beginning lace knitters. This tapered scarf can be worn a variety of ways, and the construction helps to keep your neck nice and cozy. The lace edging used in this scarf is from a stitch dictionary titled Super Stitches Knitting. A garter stitch border rolls over nicely, so you only see the stocking stitch body and lovely lace edging. (This rolling can be prevented if desired.)\n\nMuch like Traveling Woman, this pattern is easily adjusted to your preference. Like the triangular shawl shape instead? Simply knit more repeats of the increase section, and then begin your decreases immediately. Prefer fingering weight yarn? Bust out your scale and weigh your yarn periodically.\n\nDon’t be afraid to be bold with this pattern. It can be knit in almost any yarn weight in practically any size. The increase, decrease, and straight sections are designed so that they can be easily added or subtracted to the pattern.\n\nThe worsted weight sample shown has 6 increase repeats, 10 straight repeats, and 6 decrease repeats (22 leaves total). Each repeat will give you one leaf. I had less than 5 grams of yarn left when finished.\n\n[Click here](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/double-leaf-saroyan) for the Double Leaf version!\n\n* * *\n\n**Translations**\n\n- [French](http://fantaisiesdeflo.canalblog.com/archives/2010/01/14/16515294.html)\n- [Turkish](http://stitchland.blogspot.com/2010/02/saroyan-atk.html)\n- [Portuguese](http://feministy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Saroyan-portuguese.doc) (Word document)\n- [German](http://feministy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/saroyan-DE.htm)\n- [Italian](http://ilfilochecrea.blogspot.com/p/sciarpa-saroyan-di-liz-abinante.html)\n\n* * *\n\n**Errata**\n\n(1) For pages 3/4 (charts): Wherever it says “rhn” in the symbol descriptions, it should actually read “lhn” - this is in the description for all the bind-offs in rows 4 (left leaf) and 9 (right leaf).\n\n(2) In the written directions, it says “you have used 1/2 your yarn” and instructs you to begin decreases. However, if you are following the schematic you will see that decreases begin after you have used 72.5% of your yarn. You can start decreases anywhere in the pattern, as long as you have approximately 30% of your yarn left to complete the decrease section. (if you made an extra-large increase section, you must be sure to have the same quantity of yarn remaining that you used for the increase section).\n\n"
