---title:Citizen Shawl
---
"Raglan-style increases shape a shawl that rests perfectly on your shoulders for ease of wear. Eyelets break up the stocking stitch before beginning a geometric lace design. The geometric lace pattern was inspired by the architecture of the sprawling manner in Citizen Kane.\n\nAs written, the pattern will require a minimum of 440 yards. Depending on your gauge, you may need the full 500. If you have a 400 yard skein, you will probably run out towards the end!\n\nAll lace portions are charted and written. Please be sure to read through the instructions completely before knitting. The garter stitch border and the increases are charted along with the lace pattern and the written instructions.\n\n* * *\n\n**Errata**\n\nErrors in: PDF version 3   \nCorrected in: PDF version 4 (current release)   \nError: Instructions state to increase to 248 stitches total. You should increase to 251.\n\n"
