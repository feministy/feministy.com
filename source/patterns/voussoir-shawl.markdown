---title:Voussoir Shawl
---
"Voussoir Shawl is modeled after the wedge-shaped bricks that fill in the gaps in archways left behind by regular, lesser bricks. The smocked cable motif stacks rows of stitches in a similar fashion, creating miniature archways of cabled stitches. Paired with ribbing, this scarf has no proper top or bottom.\n\n* * *\n\n### About Arch Shawls\n\nComprised of 3 patterns, the Arch Shawls collection features stitch motifs inspired by elements of Venetian architecture. I donâ€™t claim to be an expert on architecture, but the vast buildings throughout Italy inspired me to create shawls based on the styles used in their unique structures.\n\nAll three shawls are single-skein projects and worked using short rows, each one making use of a cabled, lace, or textured motif.\n\nPatterns may be purchased individually ($6 each) or as a set of 3 ($16).\n\nArch Shawls includes:\n\n- \n\n[Voussoir Shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/voussoir-shawl)\n\n- \n\n[Squinch Shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/squinch-shawl/) (my personal favorite!)\n\n- \n\n[Lancet Shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lancet-shawl)\n\n"
