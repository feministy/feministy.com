<p>I had a dream I was wearing these spiral socks, and that they were lovely to knit and even more wonderful to wear. (I’m not a crazy person, I don’t normally dream about socks.) Named after my friend Eunice, these socks are sunny, fun, and a little bit odd.</p>

<p>While I could have charted this pattern or written it out row by row, it’s much easier to knit this sock if you “read” your knitting rather than follow a chart. Directions are provided with pictures, but I promise you it’s easier than it looks. By providing instructions for reading your knitting, it’s much easier to customize your sock to your liking and to adjust sizes.</p>

<p><strong>These socks are NOT mirror images of each other.</strong> I <em>hate</em> working left twist stitches :)</p>

<p>If you would like a pattern where the socks are mirror images of each other, please look at <a href='http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/down-the-rabbit-hole-2'>Down the Rabbit-Hole by Kimberly Pieper.</a></p>
