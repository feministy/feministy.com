<p>Poor Neely. She had all the talent in the world in Jacqueline Susann’s Valley of the Dolls and she ended up getting addicted to pills. It’s a story we’re all familiar with now: rising young star gets ad- dicted to toxic substance and destroys her career in the process. But, like Judy Garland, Neely will always hold a soft spot in my heart as one of the original Hollywood drama queens. Neely’s downward spiral comes to life in the stitch motif, which flows down the sock.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of this pattern, sizing is adjusted by going up a needle size. Be sure to select a sock yarn that is slightly thicker and plan to use the larger needle.</p>

<p>This pattern is written using the Magic Loop method.</p>
