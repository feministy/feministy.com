This Thanksgiving I made a pie. Making pie is a huge pain, but definitely worth it. I was going to cheat a bit and use pre-made pie crust, but after thinking about it, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Crust is my favorite part of the pie! So I broke down and made some crust, and filled it with some delicious blueberry-cherry filling. Recipe below.

Rolling out the crust. Best pie crust recipe from <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/11/pie-crust-102-all-butter-really-flaky-pie-dough/" target="_blank">Smitten Kitchen</a>.

I started with a bare bones blueberry cherry filling that called for frozen blueberries and cherry pie filling. A little basic, if you ask me. Needles to say I improved. A bit.

And then made a fancy lattice top with the crust. As much as I love crust, I can't resist the urge to make a pretty lattice.

And then I baked it, and let it cool for a few torturous hours.

Then I dug in. And it was delicious. Sweet, spicy, and perfectly crispy.
