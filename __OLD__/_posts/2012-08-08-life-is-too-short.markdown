I was reading a book review today that was lamenting about how hesitant the reviewer was to read books recommended to her because of how few books she would read in her life. I scoffed, but then I thought about it. How many books will I really read in my lifetime?

It's almost impossible to answer, especially given the freakish quantity of books I read in my youth. In junior high, our "literary arts" teacher required us to read 3 books a month. We had to log them and submit the list with a parent's signature. Every month I would submit between 30-50 books (insane, I know). I really liked the Baby Sitters Club, and I didn't play sports. I had a lot of short books, a lot of libraries, and tons of free time on my hands after I finished homework. I didn't really watch TV, I was a bookworm: if I wasn't reading, I was doing something that actively prevented it. I even tried to read in the shower, which, shockingly, doesn't really work.

Anyways. The point is: <strong>how many books can I really read in my <em>adult</em> lifetime?</strong>

If I consider "adult" to be age 18 and up, then I'd estimate that I'll have about 50 or so good, solid years of adult reading. That will get me to 68, at which point I hesitate to speculate about my potential reading abilities or health.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">50 years @ 1 book per week is</h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><em>2,600 books in my lifetime</em></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">That is <em>not enough books</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's very obvious that I am a voracious reader, but I don't always read the best books. After doing this math, I promptly went through my <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1162141?shelf=to-read">"to read" list</a> on Goodreads and started slimming it down. I'm still at about 150, and I'm a little behind on my goal of one book per week for the year: it's week 32, and I've read 24 books. Much of that is due to listening to audiobooks during my commute and knitting, rather than reading on my Kindle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But what about knitting!? There is no way that I can finish a project a week, and knitting for 50 years seems a little daunting. I've only been knitting since I was about 22, so I only have a few years under my belt. While I am a very fast knitter, I don't always have time to work on my projects. This is partly because of my job, but also partly because I spend a lot of time coordinating my design work instead of actually knitting. But still, over the course of the year, I usually manage to finish anywhere from 12-15 projects. I'm pretty proud of that. This year I haven't finished even close to what I should, but I have been doing a lot more behind-the-scenes work than in previous years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So starting from now, at age 26, if I knit for 50 years, that would put me at 76. If I'm honest with myself, I probably won't make it to 50 years of knitting: I already have troublesome joints and I don't foresee them getting any better. So lets go with 40 years of knitting, just to be safe, and 13.5 projects a year because I want to be right in the middle of my estimate.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">40 years @ 13.5 projects per year is</h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">540 completed knitting projects</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>That's... a lot.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2,600 and 540 are vastly different numbers. I'm worried that 2,600 books won't be enough, but I can't even think of 540 projects that I would want to knit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe it's the concept of completion that is the issue? When I am reading a book I don't like, I stop. I put it away, never to be finished again. But when I'm knitting a project I don't like, I rarely frog it. It will sit for years (as several projects already have), and I'll be hesitant to frog it. I have a sweater that is <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/feministy/vine-yoke-cardigan">vastly too large</a> for me that I absolutely detest, but I love the yarn and can't make myself frog it for some reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe it has something to do with fashion? A big part of the reason I enjoy knitting so much is that it gives me the ability to sculpt my own style and play with current fashion trends. Maybe I'm daunted by 540 projects because I can't think of 540 different ways I want to shape my knitting, for myself or for others.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Or, if I take the number of projects knit in 2009–a whopping 58–the number is even more terrifying: 2,320 completed knitting projects. Even with the 29 I finished in 2010 as a standard, it's 1,160 projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And after all this math, I did realize one happy thing:</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><em>My stash will not outlive me.</em></h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>I will be able to knit through my entire stash in my lifetime.</em></h3>
