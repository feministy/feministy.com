<p>When I was younger, Alice in Wonderland was one of my favorite stories. I obsessively read the novel and begged my mother to decorate my room in an Alice motif (she did, which resulted in endless nightmares about falling down rabbit holes and becoming sick from magical cookies).</p>

<p>The resurgence in Alice in Wonderland remakes has made me a very happy person. When given the chance to knit a cowl for the mystical Caterpillar himself, I jumped at it. The two stitch patterns fold into each other, one featuring whole, complete diamonds, and the other appearing to be leaves with little caterpillar bites taken out of them.</p>

<h3 id='about_the_great_cowl_kal_2012'>About The Great Cowl KAL 2012</h3>

<p>I had this crazy idea. It was my first winter in Chicago and I decided to knit myself as many cowls as humanly possible. I challenged myself to knit and design as many as possible so that I could share the fun and do a KAL with my group. Each pattern is designed to build upon a foundation of skills, increasing in complexity (but not difficulty) the further you get into the challenge.</p>

<p>I challenged knitters to complete 5 patterns in 50 days. Everyone had to submit a photo as proof of their completed project, and each knitter who submitted received the next pattern in the series for free. Flurries Cowl received over 500 submissions, and the final cowl received about 100. Approximately 100 knitters completed all 5 patterns in 50 days.</p>

<p>Each pattern in The Great Cowl KAL 2012 is available individually ($6), or in a collection of all 5 patterns ($24). This collection includes:</p>
