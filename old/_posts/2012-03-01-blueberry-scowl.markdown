<p>Scarf + cowl = scowl. I really like infinity cowls, and I also love unnecessarily long scarves. Who says you can’t have both? Knit flat, this scarf features optional buttons, allowing it to be wrapped up and worn as a cowl. This clever little project incorporates textured motifs to bring out the tonal colors in semi-solid yarns without obscuring them. Add some versatility to your wardrobe with the multi-purpose project!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The 1×1 ribbing and the 2×2 ribbing will want to block out at different widths. Block your scowl according to the 1×1 ribbing: this will leave your 2×2 ribbed edge a little relaxed.</p>

<h3 id='about_the_great_cowl_kal_2012'>About The Great Cowl KAL 2012</h3>

<p>I had this crazy idea. It was my first winter in Chicago and I decided to knit myself as many cowls as humanly possible. I challenged myself to knit and design as many as possible so that I could share the fun and do a KAL with my group. Each pattern is designed to build upon a foundation of skills, increasing in complexity (but not difficulty) the further you get into the challenge.</p>

<p>I challenged knitters to complete 5 patterns in 50 days. Everyone had to submit a photo as proof of their completed project, and each knitter who submitted received the next pattern in the series for free. Flurries Cowl received over 500 submissions, and the final cowl received about 100. Approximately 100 knitters completed all 5 patterns in 50 days.</p>

<p>Each pattern in The Great Cowl KAL 2012 is available individually ($6), or in a collection of all 5 patterns ($24). This collection includes:</p>
