---title:Thistle Cap

"I like to think I’m not a selfish knitter, but sometimes I kind of am. I spend more time designing and working up samples for patterns that I have very little time left to knit. People often expect hand knit gifts as a result of my constant needle working, and I get a wee bit stressed come holiday times. My solution? Quick, easy, unisex gift knits that can be whipped up during a movie marathon. Thistle Cap works up pretty quickly – faster if you cable without a cable needle.\n\nThistle Cap is a unisex hat that is quick to knit and fun to wear – just look at the funny faces you can make while wearing it!\n\n### Sizes\n\n- Infant (0–6 months), 16.5”/42cm circumference\n- Toddler (6–18 months), 18.5”/47cm circumference\n- Child / Women’s Small, 20”/51cm circumference\n- Women’s Medium, 22”/56cm circumference\n- Women’s Large / Men’s Small, 23”/58cm circumference\n- Men’s Medium, 25”/63.5cm circumference\n- Men’s Large, 26”/66cm circumference\n\nAll sizes require less than 180 yards aran weight yarn.\n\nThe free version of the pattern includes one size (23”/58cm).
