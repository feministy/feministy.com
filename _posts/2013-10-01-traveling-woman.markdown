<p>Being an indecisive individual, this shawl is named after two things. First, the song &#8220;Travelling Woman&#8221; by Bat for Lashes (she&#8217;s British, hence the extra &#8220;l&#8221;). &#8220;Travelling Woman&#8221; is a song about a brilliant woman with a promising future, who loses it all because she fell in love with a man who had too much potential, and not enough substance. She sings:</p>

<p><em>Hang on, travelling woman <br />Don’t sacrifice your plan <br />Cause it will come back to you <br />Before you lose it on the man.</em></p>

<p>The edge of the shawl represents the dangerous web of love, as well as its highs and lows. Along the bind off edge, the shawl can be blocked to subtle points, or straight.</p>

<p>Second, the character Angela Montenegro on Bones. If you&#8217;re familiar with Angela&#8217;s character, I think the song selection makes sense: she&#8217;s artistic, a believer in love, and just the type who might get in a little too deep before she can find her way out (she did get married in Fiji to a complete stranger, afterall). This is the second in a series of patterns based on the characters from the Bones television show.</p>

<p>And finally, the yarn used for this shawl traveled from California to London: it&#8217;s only fitting that the pattern be named Traveling Woman.</p>

<p>This is the pattern that started it all. The original. The first. The crazy idea that exploded into a series of four patterns. This new version of Traveling Woman contains instructions for 11 different sizes in 5 yarn weights: lace (medium, xlarge), fingering (xsmall, small, medium, large), sport/dk (xsmall, small, xlarge), and worsted (large, xlarge). Instructions are divided up based on yarn weights. Yarn informa- tion, gauge, and needle sizes are provided with each in- dividual set of instructions. All of the instructions use the same charts except for lace weight. Lace weight instructions have their own charts.</p>

<p>I may or may not have gone a little overboard when I decided to re-vamp the original Traveling Woman pattern. It includes a lot of upgrades! Row-by-row stitch counts are included for all of the sizes listed in the pattern. Instructions are given for common repeat sizes, as well as a formula for custom sizing.</p>

<p>Note that when purchased separately from the Traveling Woman Collection, this pattern includes 2 PDFs: one with the pattern, and one with the legends.</p>

<p>Traveling Woman includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Individual instructions for each yarn weight</li>

<li>Written and charted lace instructions</li>

<li>Row-by-row stitch counts for stockinette, Chart A, and Chart B for all sizes</li>

<li>Custom sizing formula</li>

<li>Invisible center spine</li>

<li>Working the body with eyelets (shown in lace version)</li>
</ul>
