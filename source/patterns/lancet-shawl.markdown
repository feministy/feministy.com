---title:Lancet Shawl
---
"Lancet Shawl is modeled after the Gothic lancet arches favored by Venetians, with the elaborate points of mimicking the dramatic arches in buildings across the canals. One of three in a series, the Lancet Shawl uses lace weight to emphasize the openwork lace motif.\n\nThis pattern required all 420 yards/384 meters in the skein to knit the sample shown. Plan your yarn selection accordingly.\n\n* * *\n\n### About Arch Shawls\n\nComprised of 3 patterns, the Arch Shawls collection features stitch motifs inspired by elements of Venetian architecture. I donâ€™t claim to be an expert on architecture, but the vast buildings throughout Italy inspired me to create shawls based on the styles used in their unique structures.\n\nAll three shawls are single-skein projects and worked using short rows, each one making use of a cabled, lace, or textured motif.\n\nPatterns may be purchased individually ($6 each) or as a set of 3 ($16).\n\nArch Shawls includes:\n\n- \n\n[Voussoir Shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/voussoir-shawl)\n\n- \n\n[Squinch Shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/squinch-shawl/) (my personal favorite!)\n\n- \n\n[Lancet Shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lancet-shawl)\n\n"
