A month ago I sold the bulk of my stash to help raise money for my wedding fund. I listed about 80% of the yarn that I own, and sold the majority of that. I'm not quite stash-less, but I do have a considerably smaller stash than I used to. So while I wouldn't say that I am stash-less, it is certainly a far cry from the pile of yarn I used to dive into every time I wanted to start a new project.

No longer can I spontaneously cast on a pair of socks, or quickly knit up a hat for a friend without a trip to the LYS first. I have to meticulously browse my stash, make sure my pattern selection matches the yarn I have available, and hope that I have a good color on hand.

I've also changed my buying and designing habits. I don't pick out a yarn I love at the store and take it home unless I have a pattern ready to be knit. Whether it be a sketch or draft of my own making, or a pattern by another designer, I need to have something earmarked for that yarn's purpose before I buy it.

I think about things more. I mull over whether or not I want to devote myself to knitting something until it is finished. I used to jump from project to project, rotating 3â€“5 different WIPs, but I don't have the focus for that anymore. I work on one project from start to finish, no more multi-tasking. For a project, or a yarn, to require that much attention from me, it has to be something truly amazing.

In a way, this kind of intense deliberation is good for me. I don't waste yarn by starting a project, letting it sit for tow years, and then never frogging it. I don't waste time knitting things I will never finish, and I find myself knitting less of the same thing and more of a variety. But sometimes I tend to overthink things - it's a bad habit, and encouraging myself to think about a hobby so intensely is only making the habit worse.

But really, living without a stash is kind of liberating. I don't feel restricted to only knitting projects that I have yarn for, and I don't feel like I can't buy something a little bit nicer for a large project. I don't shy away from complex colorwork anymore, and I always make sure to swatch prior to beginning my project. Instead of sticking with the same shawls and hats every time I cast on, I've branched out and have started working up more complex garments. If I only have the capacity to work on one item at a time, that item better be damn impressive when I'm done.

One thing I do miss is being able to go bonkers when a favorite yarnie has a sale, or when I see a color that I just have to own. Yarn sometimes looks so compelling in skein, and disappointing knit up, that I found myself acquiring yarn as a decoration rather than for knitting. Don't get me wrong - yarn can make a lovely decoration - but it's a bit ill-advised to decorate an apartment with colorful yarn when you have a cat and a puppy who like to eat everything in sight. It's less about the look of yarn and more about the craft that goes into creating the garment. From the yarn and fiber selection to the actual knitting and finishing, every aspect of garment creation is more emphasized for me now. I treasure it more, and I'm happier with my hobby.

And, ultimately, I am loving my finished objects more now than I ever did before.
