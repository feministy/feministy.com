<p>This is a sock I think Coraline would wear. She’s a resourceful girl who isn’t afraid of adventures. She’s smart, witty, and brave. If Coraline were a knitter, I think she’d definitely find uses for all of her scrap yarn and make something more beautiful than this.</p>

<p>I thought about knitting jacquard stars onto the socks, but I remembered Coraline’s striped socks from the film, so I went with stripes instead. A lot easier if you ask me!</p>

<p>This is a perfect pattern for sock scraps for those not ambitious enough to make a blanket.</p>
