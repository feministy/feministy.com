"An asymmetrically shaped shawl that’s surprisingly easy to wear!\n\nKnit from the bottom up, the shawl has increases incorporated into the stitch motif. With the right side facing, the shawl increases once every other row along the left edge and once every row along the right edge.\n\nThis is my favorite kind of shawl: it’s done when you say it’s done. You can keep knitting until it has reached the size you want, or you run out of yarn, and you can knit it in any yarn weight you wish. The instructions are more of a template than a pattern, don’t feel restricted by the yarn weight or size I’ve knit for myself.\n\n* * *\n\nFound an error? Leave a comment!
