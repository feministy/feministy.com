<p>I like to think I’m not a selfish knitter, but sometimes I kind of am. I spend more time designing and working up samples for patterns that I have very little time left to knit. People often expect hand knit gifts as a result of my constant needle working, and I get a wee bit stressed come holiday times. My solution? Quick, easy, unisex gift knits that can be whipped up during a movie marathon. Thistle Cap works up pretty quickly – faster if you cable without a cable needle.</p>

<p>Thistle Cap is a unisex hat that is quick to knit and fun to wear – just look at the funny faces you can make while wearing it!</p>
