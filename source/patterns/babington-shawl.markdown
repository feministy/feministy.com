---title:Babington Shawl

"Queen Anne is one of those women that I always knew about, but didn’t know about. Turns out she was a pretty bad ass lady. During her imprisonment, she never stopped plotting: whether it was escape, a coup, or how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, she was always at it. The stitch motif used in this shawl is reminiscent of the bars that confined her, and a garter stitch ruffle pays homage to Elizabethan fashion.\n\nBabington Shawl knits up very quickly, so if you’re looking for an easy pattern that flies off the needles, this is definitely for you. It requires just a bit more than 400 yards of fingering weight yarn, and does best with yarns that have a nice drape to them or some silk content. Constructed using simple short rows without wraps, Babington Shawl is well-suited for beginners who have little experience with short rows. The lace pattern is a two-row repeat and is very easy to memorize.\n\n"
