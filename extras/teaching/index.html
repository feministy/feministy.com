<h1>Teaching at your LYS</h1>

<p>
  Individual instructors or LYS may buy a teaching license. I offer them for each pattern, but I do give discounts after you buy 3 single licenses. Purchasing a Course Instruction License grants you the right to teach an unlimited number of courses from one pattern youâ€™ve selected, and to give each student with a printed copy of the pattern.
</p>


<h3>Available Single Pattern Licenses</h3>

<p>
  Each license is good for one pattern only. Note that this means <em>single patterns</em>, not ebook publications.

<h1>Hiring me to teach</h1>

<p>
  I offer single-day workshops in the Chicagoland area. Rates vary depending on the workshop.
</p>

<p>
  I don't have as much availability for workshops, classes, or speaking engagements that require traveling. I love to travel and teach, but I can only accept a few engagements a year with my work schedule. Engagements that require travel will require additional workshops and compensation for travel (unless it coincides with a personal/work trip).
</p>

<h3>Trunk shows</h3>

<p>
  I only do trunk shows in person. Sorry!
